My lady's blue eyes, staring across the desk into my lord's cool gray ones, dropped to the pile of bills under his hand. Her fair head was hung, and her nervous hands clasped one another tightly. In spite of a modish (and very expensive) morning-dress of twilled French silk, and the smart crop achieved for her golden curls by the most fashionable coiffeur in London, she looked absurdly youthful, like a schoolgirl caught out in mischief. She was, in fact, not yet nineteen years old, and she had been married for nearly a year to the gentleman standing on the other side of the desk, and so steadily regarding her.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well?'</p> <p>She swallowed rather convulsively. The Earl had spoken quite gently, but her ears were quick to catch the note of implacability in his voice. She stole a scared look up at him, and dropped her eyes again, colouring. He was not frowning, but there was no doubt that he meant to obtain an answer to the quite unanswerable question he had put to his erring bride.</p> <p>Another silence fell, broken only by the ticking of the large clock on the mantelpiece. My lady gripped her fingers so tightly together that they whitened.</p> <p>&#x2018;I asked you, Nell, why all these tradesmen ' the Earl lifted the bills and let them fall again &#x2018;have found it necessary to apply to me for the settlement of their accounts?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I am very sorry!' faltered the Countess.</p> <p>&#x2018;But that doesn't answer my question,' he said dryly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well well, I expect it was because I because I forgot to pay them myself!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Forgot?'</p> <p>Lower sank her golden head; she swallowed again.</p> <p>&#x2018;Under the hatches yet again, Nell?'</p> <p>She nodded guiltily, her colour deepening.</p> <p>His expression was inscrutable, and for a moment he said nothing. His gaze seemed to consider her, but what thoughts were running in his head it would have been impossible to have guessed. &#x2018;I appear to make you a very inadequate allowance,' he observed.</p> <p>The knowledge that the allowance he made her was a very handsome one caused her to cast an imploring glance up at him and to stammer: &#x2018;Oh, no, no!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Then why are you in debt?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I have bought things which perhaps I should not,' she said desperately. &#x2018;This this gown, for instance! Indeed, I am sorry. I won't do so any more!'</p> <p>&#x2018;May I see your paid bills?'</p> <p>This was said more gently still, but it effectively drove the flush from her cheeks. They became as white as they had before been red. To be sure, she had any number of receipted bills, but none knew better than she that their total, staggering though it might seem to the daughter of an impoverished peer, did not account for half of that handsome allowance which was paid quarterly to her bankers. At any moment now my lord would ask the question she dreaded, and dared not answer truthfully.</p> <p>It came. &#x2018;Three months ago, Nell,' said the Earl, in a measured tone, &#x2018;I forbade you most straitly to pay any more of your brother's debts. You gave me your word that you would not. Have you done so?'</p> <p>She shook her head. It was dreadful to lie to him, but what else was to be done when he looked so stern, and had shown himself so unsympathetic to poor Dysart? It was true that Dysart's recurring difficulties were all due to his shocking luck; and it seemed that Cardross couldn't understand how unjust it was to blame Dysart for his inability to abandon gaming and racing. That Fatal Tendency, said Mama, with resignation, ran in the family: Grandpapa had died under a cloud of debt; and Papa, with the hopeful intention of restoring the fortunes of his house, had still more heavily mortgaged his estates. That was why Papa had been so overjoyed when Cardross had offered for her hand. For Cardross was as well-born as he was wealthy, and Papa had previously been obliged to face the horrid necessity of giving his eldest daughter to the highest bidder, even (dreadful thought!) if this should prove to be a rich merchant with social aspirations. He had done so with great fortitude, and he had had his reward: in her very first season indeed, before she had been out a month Cardross had not only seen the Lady Helen Irvine, but had apparently decided that she was the bride for whom he had so long waited. Such a piece of good fortune had never even occurred to Lord Pevensey. It was certainly to be supposed that Cardross, past thirty, and with no nearer relation than a cousin to succeed him, must be contemplating marriage in the not too distant future, but such was his consequence that he might have had the pick of all the damsels faithfully presented by their mamas at the Queen's Drawing-rooms, and thereafter exhibited by them at Almack's Assembly Rooms, and all the ton parties. Moreover, to judge by the style of the lady who was pretty generally known to be his mistress, his taste was for something older and by far more sophisticated than a child fresh from the schoolroom. Never had Papa thought to see his little Nell do so well for the family! In the event, her success, and Cardross's generosity proved to be rather too much for him: hardly had he led his child to the altar than he suffered a stroke. The doctors assured his lady that he had many years of life before him, but the visitation had rendered him so far incapable that he had had to abandon his usual pursuits, and to retire to the seclusion of his ancestral home in Devonshire, where, it was the earnest if unexpressed hope of his wife and son-in-law, he would be obliged to remain.</p> <p>Nell did not know just what Cardross had done to earn her parents' gratitude. It all came under the vague title of Settlements, and she was not to bother her pretty head over it, but to take care always to conduct herself with dignity and discretion. Mama, declaring herself to be deeply thankful, had made quite plain to her what her duty henceforward would be. It included such things as always showing my lord an amiable countenance, and never embarrassing him by asking ill-bred questions, or appearing to be aware of it if (perhaps) he was found to have formed a Connection outside the walls of that splendid house of his in Grosvenor Square. &#x2018;One thing I am sure of,' had said Mama, fondly patting Nell's hand, &#x2018;and that is that he will treat you with the greatest consideration! His manners, too, are so particularly good that I am persuaded you will never have cause to complain of the sort of neglect, or or indifferent civility, which is the lot of so many females in your situation. I assure you, my love, there is nothing more mortifying than to be married to a man who lets it be seen that his affections are elsewhere engaged.'</p> <p>Mama should have known, for this had been her fate. What Mama did not know, and no one must ever guess, was that her carefully instructed daughter had tumbled headlong into love with my lord at their very first meeting, when Lady Jersey, one of the Patronesses of Almack's, had brought him across the room to be introduced to her, and she had looked up into his eyes, and had seen them smiling down at her. No, Mama had no suspicion of that. Mama was all sensibility, but she knew that marriage had nothing to do with romance. It had been her dread, she confided, that Nell would be married to a man whom she could not like, but she was quite sure that Nell must like so charming and so handsome a gentleman as Cardross. And, what was more, there could be little doubt that he was disposed to hold his bride in considerable affection. He had actually desired Lady Jersey to present him to her, on that memorable evening; and what he had said later to Papa, when he had made his offer, had quite soothed a mother's anxiety. Nell would meet with nothing but courtesy and consideration at his hands.</p> <p>It hadn't seemed possible to Nell, lost in love, that Cardross could have proposed to her only because she was pretty, and well-born, and rather more pleasing to him than any of the other young ladies who met his critical eye, but Mama had been right. When Nell had met my lord's half-sister and ward, a vivid brunette, not then out, but hopeful of being presented by her sister-in-law, that impetuous damsel had exclaimed, warmly embracing her: &#x2018;Oh, how pretty you are! Prettier by far than Giles's mistress! How famous if you were to put her nose out of joint!'</p> <p>It had been a dreadful shock, but Nell had not betrayed herself, which was some small consolation; and she was thankful to have been made aware of the truth before she could render herself ridiculous by showing her heart to the world, or have become a tiresome bore to my lord by hanging on him in the doting way which one short season had taught her was considered by the modish to be not at all the thing. As for putting Lady Orsett's nose out of joint it had not taken her long to discover the identity of my lord's mistress that ambition probably belonged, like her earlier dreams, to the realm of make-believe, and certainly seemed very far from achievement today, when my lord was commanding her to account for her debts.</p> <p>&#x2018;Tell me the truth, Nell!'</p> <p>His voice, quite kind, but unmistakably imperative, recalled her from her hurrying, jumbled thoughts. But it was impossible to tell him the truth, because even if he forgave her for having disobeyed him he was very unlikely to forgive Dysart, for whom, in his eyes, there could be no excuse at all. And if he refused to rescue Dysart from his difficulties any more, and made it impossible for her to do so either, what would become of Dy, or, for that matter, of poor Papa? Not so long ago he had said, a trifle grimly, that the best turn he could render Dysart would be to buy him a pair of colours, and pack him off to join Lord Wellington's army in the Peninsula; and it was all too probable that this was precisely what he would do if this fresh disaster came to his ears. Nor was there much doubt that Dysart would jump at the offer, because he had always hankered after a military career. Only Papa, with his ...</p></p><h2>Time and Time Again: A Novel</h2><p><p><b><i>If you had one chance to change history...Where would you go? What would you do?

Mysteries involving children are always rather difficult, and in this case, making this more complicated is the fact that it's her adopted daughter's school. Meanwhile, her trusted assistant, Grace Makutsi, is having trouble adjusting to wedded bliss, a problem that may test even Precious Ramotswe's formidable talents. Finally, Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi meet an old mentor for the first time, when the estimable Clovis Andersen, author of their personal manual, <b>Principles of Private Investigation</b><i>, </i>arrives in Botswana on a case. All this and bush tea too--life is indeed rich in Botswana.</p><p>ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH is also the author of the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh and has served on many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics. He was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe and taught law at the University of Botswana. He lives in Scotland, where in his spare time he is a bassoonist in the RTO (Really Terrible Orchestra).In Botswana, home to the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency for the problems of ladies, and others, it is customary&#x2014;one might say <i>very customary</i>&#x2014;to enquire of the people whom you meet whether they have slept well. The answer to that question is almost inevitably that they have indeed slept well, even if they have not, and have spent the night tossing and turning as a result of the nocturnal barking of dogs, the activity of mosquitoes or the prickings of a bad conscience. Of course, mosquitoes may be defeated by nets or sprays, just as dogs may be roundly scolded; a bad conscience, though, is not so easily stifled. If somebody were to invent a spray capable of dealing with an uncomfortable conscience, that person would undoubtedly do rather well&#x2014;but perhaps might not sleep as soundly as before, were he to reflect on the consequences of his invention. Bad consciences, it would appear, are there for a purpose: to make us feel regret over our failings. Should they be silenced, then our entirely human weaknesses, our manifold omissions, would become all the greater&#x2014;and that, as Mma Ramotswe would certainly say, is not a good thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe was fortunate in having an untroubled con-science, and therefore generally enjoyed undisturbed sleep. It was her habit to take to her bed after a final cup of red bush tea at around ten o&#x2019;clock at night. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her husband and by common consent the finest mechanic in all Botswana, would often retire before her, particularly if he had had a tiring day at work. Mechanics in general sleep well, as do many others whose day is taken up with physically demanding labour. So by the time that Mma Ramotswe went to bed, he might already be lost to this world, his breathing deep and regular, his eyes firmly closed to the bedside light that he would leave for his wife to extinguish.<br>&nbsp;<br>She would not take long to go to sleep, drifting off to thoughts of what had happened that day; to images of herself drinking tea in the office or driving her van on an errand; to the picture of Mma Makutsi sitting upright at her desk, her large glasses catching the light as she held forth on some issue or other. Or to some memory of a long time ago, of her father walking down a dusty road, holding her hand and explaining to her about the ways of cattle&#x2014;a subject that he knew so well. When a wise man dies, there is so much history that is lost: that is what they said, and Mma Ramotswe knew it to be true. Her own father, the late Obed Ramotswe, had taken so much with him, but had also left much behind, so many memories and sayings and observations, that she, his daughter, could now call up and cherish as she waited for the soft arms of sleep to embrace her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe did not remember her dreams for very long once she had woken up. Occasionally, though, an egregiously vivid dream might make such an impression that it lodged in her memory, and that is what happened that morning. It was not in any way a bad dream; nor was it a particularly good dream, the sort of dream that makes one feel as if one has been vouchsafed some great mystical insight; it was, rather, one of those dreams that seems to be a clear warning that something special is about to happen. If a dream involves lottery tickets and numbers, then its meaning is clear enough. This dream was not like that, and yet it left Mma Ramotswe feeling that she had somehow been given advance notice of something out of the ordinary, something important.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this dream she was walking along a path in the stretch of bush immediately behind Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the building that the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency shared with Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s garage. She was not sure where she was going, but this did not seem to matter as Mma Ramotswe felt happy just to be walking along it with no great sense of having to reach a destination. And why should one not walk along a path, particularly a comfortable path, without any idea of getting anywhere?<br>&nbsp;<br>She turned a corner and found herself faced with a large acacia tree, its foliage extending out like the canopy of a commodious umbrella. To dream of trees is to . . . to long for trees, and finding herself under the shade of this tree would have been enough to make the dream a satisfactory one. But there was more to it. Underneath the tree, standing in such a position that the mottled shade of the leaves all but obscured his face, was a tall, well-built man. He now stepped forward, held out a hand and said, &#x201c;I have come at last, Mma Ramotswe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that was the point at which Mma Ramotswe awoke. The encounter with this stranger had not been threatening in any way; there had been nothing in his demeanour that was suggestive of hostility, and she had not felt in the slightest bit anxious. As for what he said, she had simply thought, even if she had not had the time to say it, <i>Yes, it has been a long time.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>For a few minutes after waking, she had lain still in bed, mulling over the dream. Had the man been her father, then the dream would have been easy to understand. She knew that she dreamed of her father from time to time, which was only to be expected, given that not a day went past, not one day, when she did not think of that great and good man, the late Obed Ramotswe. If you think of somebody every day, then you can be sure you will dream of him at night; but it was not him whom she encountered under that acacia tree&#x2014;that was very clear. It was somebody quite different, somebody she sensed was from a long way away. But who could that be? Mma Ramotswe did not really know anybody from a long way away, unless one counted Francistown or Maun, where she knew a number of people. But those towns, although several hundred miles from Gaborone, are both in Botswana, and nowhere in Botswana was the abode of strangers. That was because Botswana, to those who lived there, was home, and familiar, and comfortable, and no place in such a country will seem far away. No, this man under the tree was from somewhere outside the country, and that was unusual and puzzling and would have to be thought about at some length.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very unusual dream,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi as they attended to the morning&#x2019;s mail in the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked up from the envelope that she was in the process of slitting open. &#x201c;Dreams are always unusual,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In fact, it is unusual to have a usual dream.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe frowned. She thought that she understood what Mma Makutsi meant but was not quite sure. Her assistant had a habit of making enigmatic remarks, and this, she suspected, was one such remark.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Phuti,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi continued, referring to her new husband, Phuti Radiphuti, &#x201c;Phuti has many dreams, every night. He tells me about them and I explain what they mean.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;He often dreams about furniture.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is because he has a furniture shop,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe said. &#x201c;So perhaps it is not surprising.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is so, Mma,&#x201d; agreed Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;But he can dream about different pieces of furniture.&#x201d; She paused, fixing Mma Ramotswe on the other side of the room with the cautious look of one about to reveal sensitive information. She lowered her voice. &#x201c;Some nights he dreams about beds; other nights he dreams about dining room tables. It is very strange.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked down at her desk. She did not like to discuss the intimate side of anybody&#x2019;s marriage&#x2014;particularly when the marriage was as recent as Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s. She thought of new marriages as being rather like those shy, delicate flowers one sees on the edge of the Kalahari; so small that one might miss them altogether, so vulnerable that a careless step might crush their beauty. Of course, people talked about their dreams without too much embarrassment&#x2014;most dreams, after all, sound inconsequential and silly in the cold light of day&#x2014;but it was different when a wife talked about a husband&#x2019;s dreams, or a husband about a wife&#x2019;s. Dreams occurred in beds, and what occurred in marital beds was not a subject for debate in the office&#x2014;especially if the dream <i>related to </i>beds, as it appeared that some of Phuti Radiphuti&#x2019;s dreams did.<br>&nbsp;<br>But if Mma Ramotswe was reluctant to probe Phuti&#x2019;s dreams too closely, the same was not true of her assistant. The topic had now been broached, and Mma Makutsi pursued it enthusiastically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is no doubt about a dream about beds,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;The meaning of that dream is very clear, Mma. It should be very obvious, even to a person who does not know much about dreams, or other things, for that matter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe said nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;if a person says <i>I have been dreaming about beds, </i>then you know straight away what the dream means. You can say to them, <i>I know what that dream means. It is very clear.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked out of the window, which was high, and gave a view from that angle only of a slice of blue; empty blue; blue with no white of cloud; nothingness. &#x201c;Is the meaning of dreams clear, Mma? Do any dreams make sense, or are they just like . . . like clouds in the sky, composed of nothing very much? Maybe they are clouds in our mind, Mma; maybe that is what they are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was having none of this. &#x201c;The meaning is often clear,&#x201d; she retorted. &#x201c;I have no difficulty, Mma, in understanding a dream about beds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe sighed. &#x201c;Well, they do say, don&#x2019;t they, Mma, that men have such things on their minds most of the time. They say that men think only of that, all day. Listen to the way Charlie speaks when he thinks you can&#x2019;t hear him. That shows you what men think about&#x2014;or at least, young men. I do not think that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has thoughts like that in his head all day. I do not think that, Mma.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was as if Mma Makutsi had not heard her. &#x201c;Yes, Mma. The meaning of a dream about beds is very simple. It means that you are tired. It means that you need more sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe stared at her assistant for a few moments. Then, with some degree of relief, she smiled. &#x201c;Well, there you have it, Mma. That must be what such a dream means.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On the other hand,&#x201d; went on Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;a dream about a dining-room table is different. That does not mean that you are tired.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, it does not mean that, Mma. A dream about a dining-room table means that you are hungry. I think that is very obvious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked first at the teapot, and then at the clock. She would wait, she decided; if one kept bringing forward the time at which one had tea, then the period after teatime would become far too long. Tea had to be taken at the right time; if anything was clear, it was that.<br>&nbsp;<br>She decided to steer the conversation back to her own dream. But just as she was about to do so, Mma Makutsi came up with a further observation on Phuti&#x2019;s dreams. &#x201c;When he said to me one morning that he had dreamed of dining-room tables, I was worried. Was I giving him enough to eat, I wondered?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what did you decide, Mma?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m giving him enough food. I believe in demand feeding. I think that is what it&#x2019;s called. I always leave some food out in the kitchen so that Phuti can pick up a snack if he feels hungry. There are other women who believe that you should only feed your husband at set times, so that he gets used to it. But I am not one of those women, Mma. I leave food out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe suppressed a grin at the thought of demand feeding for husbands. The conversation, although potentially sensitive, had proved to be more amusing than anything else, and she knew that it could drift on indefinitely. It was her own dream that had started it, and it was to her dream that she now returned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very strange dream last night, Mma,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As I was saying.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please tell me what it was, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;I cannot guarantee that I will be able to tell you what it means, but we shall see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I dreamed that I was walking along a path,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe began. &#x201c;And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi interrupted her. &#x201c;That means you are going on a journey, Mma. There can be no doubt about that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe acknowledged this. &#x201c;Possibly. But then the path came to a place&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is your destination,&#x201d; announced Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;Thatplace that you saw in your dream was your destination in life. That is very clear indeed. What was it like, Mma? Was it a very good place?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There was an acacia tree&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again there was an interjection. &#x201c;Then that means you are going to end up under a tree, Mma. That is where you will find yourself, under a tree.&#x201d; She looked at Mma Ramotswe sympathetically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is not too bad, Mma. There are many worse places to end up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But the tree was not all that important,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe, raising her voice slightly to prevent further interruption. &#x201c;There was a man standing under the tree. It was as if he was waiting for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That will be Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe shook her head. &#x201c;It was not him. It was a man I had never seen before. And he did not come from here. He was a stranger.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s glasses flashed in a slanting band of sunlight. &#x201c;Not from Gaborone?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Not from Botswana?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. He was from somewhere else. He was not an African at all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was silent. Then she delivered her judgement. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger,&#x201d; she said, with an air of gravity. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger under an acacia tree.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I thought it might mean something like that,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;But then I thought that it probably didn&#x2019;t mean anything at all. That it was just a dream, and I would forget about it by this afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked doubtful. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should forget it, Mma Ramotswe. I think that you should remember it, so that when it happens, when you meet that stranger under the acacia tree, you will be prepared.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She said nothing more, but gave Mma Ramotswe an oblique look; a look that Mma Ramotswe interpreted as a warning. But she had not understood&#x2014;for all her claims to understanding dreams, Mma Makutsi had missed the point. This stranger was not threatening; this stranger, for whom Mma Makutsi said she should be prepared, was not somebody to be dreaded or guarded against. On the contrary, this stranger was a good man, a kind man, and his arrival&#x2014;if he were ever to come, which was highly unlikely&#x2014;was something to be welcomed, something to be celebrated. And there was something else&#x2014;something that was hard to put into words. The man in the dream might have been a stranger in that she had never seen him before, but somehow she felt that she knew him. <i>She knew him but did not know him.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She glanced at her watch again. Resolve can be weakened by time, and by talk about dreams and by heat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a bit early, but I think that we should have tea now,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi. And Mma Makutsi, who had removed her glasses to clean them, looked up, finished her task of polishing the lenses and said that she completely agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On a hot day,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;we dream of tea.&#x201d;</p><h2>100 amazing facts about the negro</h2><p><p>First published in 1934 and revised in 1962, this book gathers journalist and historian Joel Augustus Rogers' columns from the syndicated newspaper feature titled Your History. Patterned after the look of Ripley's popular Believe It or Not the multiple vignettes in each episode recount short items from Rogers's research. The feature began in the Pittsburgh Courier in November 1934 and ran through the 1960s.</p></p><p>JOEL AUGUSTUS ROGERS (September 6, 1880&#x2013;March 26, 1966) was a Jamaican-American author, journalist, and historian who contributed to the history of Africa and the African diaspora, especially the history of African Americans in the United States. His research spanned the academic fields of history, sociology and anthropology. He challenged prevailing ideas about race, demonstrated the connections between civilizations, and traced African achievements. He was one of the greatest popularizers of African history in the twentieth century. Rogers addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, the lack of black history being told from a black person&#x2019;s perspective, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history.<br><br>A respected historian and gifted lecturer, Rogers was a close personal friend of the Harlem-based intellectual and activist Hubert Harrison. In the 1920s, Rogers worked as a journalist on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Enterprise, and he served as the first black foreign correspondent from the United States.&#x201c;Rogers committed his life to fighting against racism and he has a major influence on black print culture through his attempts to improve race relations in the United States and challenge white supremacist tracts aimed at disparaging the history and contributions of people of African descent to world civilizations.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thabiti Asukile, in &#x201c;Black International Journalism, Archival Research and Black Print Culture&#x201d;, <i><b>The Journal of African American History</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;I have been intrigued by this book, and by its author, since I first encountered it as a student in an undergraduate survey course in African-American history at Yale.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., <i><b>The Root</b></i></p><h2>The Hynek UFO Report</h2><p>The world&#39;s foremost expert on UFOs explains why the Air Force&#39;s Project Blue Book was kept secret and why it was recently declassified and investigates sightings reported in its files</p><p></p><h2>Willem De Kooning: Paintings</h2><p>Catalogue for the traveling exhibition. Essays by David Sylvester and Richard Shiff. Catalogue by Marla Prather. Illustrated in colour and b/w throughout. Publishers colour illustrated wrappers</p><p>Abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning turns 90 this spring, and this handsome catalogue of a large retrospective at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., (which later travels to Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum) celebrates his virtuosity and ever-changing idioms. Aided by 80 color and 50 black-and-white plates, exhibit curator Prather presents commentaries on specific groups of paintings, such as the somber, enigmatic male figures from the 1930s, the urban and pastoral abstract landscapes of the '50s, the blossoming fields of color from the '70s and the feathery, luminous abstractions of the mid-1980s. Sylvester, an art critic, examines de Kooning's indebtedness to cubism as well as his influence on such artists as Joan Mitchell and Francis Bacon. Shiff, an art history professor at the University of Texas, provocatively explores de Kooning's preoccupation with certain recurring body features--eyes, mouth, breasts, genitals, feet--and shows how he fused the clasical tradition of nudity with contemporary styles in advertising and pop imagery. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Arriving in the United States as an illegal immigrant from Rotterdam in 1926, de Kooning became one of the most influential American painters of this century and a pioneer of Abstract Expressionism. This handsome catalog of 76 major works chronicles over 50 year of the artist's slashing style and shows how he freely moved between figure and abstract painting, changing focus throughout his career and often blurring the line between the two. David examines de Kooning's indebtedness to Cubism and influence on such artists as Francis Bacon and Joan Mitchell, Richard explores recurring themes and iconography, and Prather comments on groups of paintings from the 1930s to mid-1980s.

'The Devil Comes to Orekhovo,' about a trio of Russian soldiers on night patrol in Chechnya, may be the best Hemingway story that Hemingway never wrote. And the wistful 'Barefoot Girl in Clover' an ex-jock's reminiscences about a romance he now realizes was the love of his life--could even teach the Greeks (if not Pitt) something about tragedy. A-" -<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> <p> "Eight deliciously accessible stories follow the author's first novel (<i>The 25th Hour</i>, 2001) and his screenplay for <i>Troy</i>. All of these will hook you fast, and they'll keep you hooked, with the possible exception of "De Composition," a run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic sketch. One story, "The Devil Comes to Orekovo," is thrillingly good. An 18-year-old soldier, Leksi, is on patrol with two hardened veterans. They order him to kill a defenseless old woman suspected of funding terrorists, though Leksi has never killed anybody. The soldiers are Russian and the woman is Chechen, but this study of war's brutal choices transcends time and place; the denouement has the satisfying inevitability of a work of art. Not quite in that league, but impressive nonetheless, is the title story, where Tabachnik, a talent scout for a major West Coast label, has his eyes on a singer with a punk-rock band playing New York. Moving cautiously, he detaches her from a poorly written contract and from her boyfriend, SadJoe, who stages a futile protest on the Los Angeles sidewalks. In the battle between blue-collar solidarity and really big bucks, old loyalties don't stand a chance. Show-biz opportunity comes knocking again in the slighter but well-crafted "Garden of No" as actress/waitress June gets her big break and, hating herself, flees from boyfriend Sam, the short-order cook. Benioff further demonstrates his range in "Barefoot Girl in Clover" (a former high school football star who goes searching for the lost love of his youth gets whipsawed by the past), "Merde for Luck" (two gay men struggle to stave off AIDS), and the barbed whimsy of "Zoanthropy," in which lions roam Manhattan and a humble museum guard claimshe's The Lover of the East Coast. The big city nurtures tall tales, a point made again in "Neversink," in which a young woman lures suitors by inventing a father who was, supposedly, a ferocious ex-biker and pal of Sinatra's. Technical accomplishment that's matched by a generosity of spirit. -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>David Benioff was born and raised in New York City. He adapted his first novel, <i>The 25th Hour</i>, into the feature film directed by Spike Lee. With many other screenplays to his credit, he is also the writer of the films, "Brothers" and "X-Men Origins: Wolverine".

It's a department known within the force as "The Dark Side," and it's where Malcolm Fox works. He's a serious man with a father in a nursing home and a sister who persists in an abusive relationship, frustrating problems about which he cannot seem to do anything. <br><br>Then the reluctant Fox is given a new case. There's a cop named Jamie Breck, and he's dirty. The problem is, no one can prove it. As Fox takes on the job, he learns that there's more to Breck than anyone thinks--dangerous knowledge, especially when a vicious murder takes place far too close to home.<br><br>In THE COMPLAINTS, Rankin proves again why he is one of the world's most beloved and bestselling crime writers, mixing unstoppable pacing with the deeper question of who decides right from wrong.</p><p>Ian Rankin is a #1 international bestselling author. Winner of an Edgar Award and the recipient of a Gold Dagger for fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.*Starred Review* In the wake of Exit Music (2008), the concluding volume in his celebrated John Rebus series,Rankin has picked a most unlikely new hero. Edinburgh cop Malcolm Fox works for &#x201c;the Complaints,&#x201d; the despised internal-affairs division whose job it is to investigate other cops. Succeeding the Rebus novels, starring the quintessential maverick copper, with a series built around a cop-hunting cop seems akin to J. K. Rowling following Harry Potter with seven extra-thick novels about a classroom tattletale. And, yet, Rankin pulls it off, making Fox the fall guy in an elaborate police conspiracy and causing him to join forces with a detective under suspicion of peddling child porn. The strange-bedfellows angle drives the interpersonal dynamics here&#x2014;and augurs well for future installments&#x2014;as Fox, working off the books, investigates the murder of someone very close to home and attempts to turn the frame-up on its end. Some crime writers keep writing the same series with different characters, but Rankin deserves credit for going another way altogether. Fox is a good and quiet citizen compared to Rebus (he doesn&#x2019;t drink and listens to birdsong on the radio, not classic rock), but Rankin doesn&#x2019;t hold any of that against his new hero, proving that you can build complex, highly textured, series-worthy characters from the most unlikely of raw materials.

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Rick&#39;s first novel featuring the heroic young demigod, was the overall winner of the Red House Children&#39;s Book Award in 2006.The fifth volume of the Percy Jackson adventure series follows the travails of the 15-year-old half-human son of the Greek god Poseidon. The dyslexic, hyperactive teen takes on the curse of Achilles&#39;s heel, discovers newfound powers, visits the kingdom of Poseidon, and finds romance as a battle mounts against Kronos. With a touch of teenage geekiness to his voice, Jesse Bernstein is able to master Percy&#39;s sense of angst. While his voice is youthful, however, Bernstein lacks the speed and energy to allow listeners to completely suspend disbelief, and his tone lapses into a whining quality that some may find off-putting.

The landing of a helicopter brings the Sisterhood its most daunting--and rewarding--mission yet. Original. It&#39;s been years since the members of the Sisterhood first banded together, with the help of their mentor Charles Martin, to exact their own form of justice on those whose crimes had gone unpunished by the legal system. Now, back in the United States after an enforced exile, and ensconced in a new home on Big Pine Mountain in North Carolina, Myra, Kathryn, Annie, Alexis, Isabelle, Yoko, and Nikki are breathing easy at last - but not for long. One dark night, under cover of a vicious storm, a helicopter lands on their mountain. The Sisters aren&#39;t about to wait to be ambushed. Braving the storm, they set out to greet their guests, only to be told by Charles that the mysterious visitors are the Sisterhood&#39;s new employers, and they&#39;ve got a dangerous new assignment in mind. The task they face is daunting. If they succeed, the Sisterhood will be rewarded beyond their wildest dreams. If they fail, they&#39;ll forfeit much more than a paycheck. But if the Ladies of Pinewood have learned one thing over the course of their adventures, it&#39;s that when friends band together, miracles can happen...</p><p></p><h2>Arthur Rackham&#39;s Book of pictures</h2><p>This wonderful survey of the famed artist's early work features 44&nbsp;color plates in addition to several black-and-white vignettes and spot illustrations.

Her husband Calvin is completely supportive and said she <i>must</i> be a literary woman. Harriet's sister, Catharine, worries she will lose her identity in marriage, but she is determined to preserve her independent spirit. Deeply religious, she strongly believes God has called her to fulfill the roles of wife and writer and will help her accomplish everything she was born to do.<br><br> Two months after her wedding Harriet discovers she is pregnant just as Calvin prepares to leave for a European business trip. Alone, Harriet is overwhelmed-being a wife has been harder than she thought and being an expectant mother feels like living another woman's life. Knowing that part of Calvin still cherishes the memory of his first wife, Harriet begins to question her place in her husband's heart and yearns for his return; his letters are no substitute for having him home. When Calvin returns, however, nothing seems to have turned out as planned.<br><br> Struggling to balance the demands of motherhood with her passion for writing and her desire to be a part of the social change in Ohio, Harriet works to build a life with her beloved Calvin despite differing temperaments and expectations.<br><br> Can their love endure, especially after "I do"? Can she recapture the first blush of new love and find the true beauty in her marriage?</p><p>Josi S. Kilpack is the author of twenty-five novels, including A Culinary Mystery series and several titles in A Proper Romance series and A Historical Proper Romance series. Her novel <i>A Heart Revealed</i> was a 2015 <i>Publishers Weekly Best Romance Book of the Year</i>. She and her husband, Lee, are the parents to four children."In her latest marvelously engaging historical novel, Kilpack writes with great insight and superb sensitivity about the ways in which Harriet and Calvin struggled to achieve a marriage that works for both of them. At the same time, Kilpack deftly demonstrates how Harriet's early married years acted as a sort of literary petri dish in which she refined her own writing skills while also defining her thoughts on the issue of slavery, ultimately leading her to write <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>, a novel which played a major role in advancing the abolitionist cause not just in the United States but around the world." --Booklist Starred Review!</p><h2>Deadly Night (LARGE PRINT)</h2><p>Used.

So before we get into the questions that particularly concern finances after 50, I&#x2019;d like to share some financial steps that I believe are essential at every age&#x2014;�whether you&#x2019;re 25, 50, or 75. Think of them as exercises you can do to make sure you&#x2019;re in the best financial shape for whatever the next phase of your life brings. I suggest you review them one by one, and keep them handy for future reference. And please share them with anyone&#x2014;�at any age&#x2014;�who wants to be financially fit.<br><br>1. Figure Out Your Net Worth<br><br>This simply means writing down and adding up what you own (your assets) and then subtracting what you owe (your liabilities). Are you in the plus or the minus? Knowing your net worth will help you decide next steps for saving, debt reduction, and budgeting. It also gives you a way to measure future progress. If your net worth is in the plus, great. If it&#x2019;s in the minus, read on. Many of the questions in this book will help you take positive action.<br><br>Set Up a Personal Net Worth Statement in Three Easy Steps<br><br>Setting up a net worth statement is as easy as creating a simple checklist and doing some basic math.<br><br>1.List your assets (what you own), estimate the value of each, and add up the total. Include items such as:<br><br>oMoney in your bank accounts<br><br>oValue of your investment accounts<br><br>oValue of your car<br><br>oValue of your home<br><br>oBusiness interests<br><br>oPersonal property, such as jewelry, art, furniture<br><br>oCash value of any insurance policies<br><br>2.List your liabilities (what you owe), and add up the outstanding balances. Include items such as:<br><br>oMortgage<br><br>oCar loan<br><br>oCredit card balance<br><br>oStudent loans<br><br>3.Subtract your liabilities from your assets to determine your personal net worth.<br><br>2. Track Your Spending and Make a Budget<br><br>Now that you have the big picture, let&#x2019;s get into the details. Are you on top of monthly expenses? Write down your essential expenses such as your mortgage, food, transportation, utilities, and loan payments. (Include savings in this list!) Then write down nonessentials&#x2014;�restaurants, entertainment, even clothes. Be sure to factor in big-�ticket items that come periodically, such as insurance premiums and real estate taxes. Does your income easily cover all this? If it doesn&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s time to prioritize.<br><br>Smart Move: Track your spending for thirty days. Does reality match your projections? If you need to cut back, Question 2 has some practical suggestions.<br><br>3. Reduce Your Debt<br><br>Should you get out of all debt? Not necessarily. Some debt, like a mortgage, can actually work in your favor. But how much debt is too much? An industry rule of thumb is that no more than 28 percent of your pretax income should go toward home debt; no more than 36 percent should go toward all debt (home, car, credit cards, etc.). If possible, it&#x2019;s wise to stay well below those limits. For more on debt reduction, see Question 13.<br><br>Smart Move: To efficiently pay down credit card debt, focus on the highest interest rate balances first.<br><br>Good Debt vs. Bad Debt<br><br>Not all debt is equal. Some types of debt can be used as a financial tool to provide opportunities; other types can derail your carefully laid plans. The key is to know the difference.<br><br>�Debt that can work for you&#x2014;�To work for you, debt should ideally be low-�cost and have potential tax advantages. For instance, with mortgages and home equity lines of credit, you&#x2019;re borrowing to own a potentially appreciating asset, and it may be tax-�deductible. You can deduct the interest on mortgage debt of up to $1.1 million on your primary and/or secondary residence, whether the loan is to purchase the home or make major improvements. (Up to $100,000 of this can be home equity debt such as a home equity line of credit, which can be used for any purpose; be sure to check with your tax advisor.) Likewise student loans have comparatively low rates, and interest can be tax-�deductible, depending on your income. The benefit is enhanced career opportunities and increased earning potential.<br><br>�Debt that can work against you&#x2014;�Generally speaking, debt that&#x2019;s high-�cost and isn&#x2019;t tax-�deductible is bad for you. Think credit cards and auto loans. This type of debt usually carries the highest interest rates. It&#x2019;s the most costly over time. And it means you&#x2019;re borrowing to own something that depreciates, so you&#x2019;re immediately losing value&#x2014;�like when you drive a new car off the lot!<br><br>4. Create an Emergency Fund<br><br>What if the unexpected happens&#x2014;�you lose your job or have a medical emergency? Will you have the cash you need? Best to build an emergency fund that covers at least three months of essential living expenses so you don&#x2019;t derail your financial plans. Keep these funds in a checking or savings account, or a money market fund where they&#x2019;re easily accessible. If you have enough equity in your home and have good credit, you might also consider opening a home equity line of credit (HELOC). You don&#x2019;t pay any interest until you use it, and if you do, interest payments may be tax-�deductible. It&#x2019;s a smart way to cover yourself &#x201c;just in case.&#x201d;<br><br>5. Determine If Your Retirement Savings Are on Track<br><br>The earlier you start, the less you&#x2019;ll have to save each year. If you&#x2019;re 50 and haven&#x2019;t started to save for retirement, you&#x2019;re going to have to sock away a large percentage of your income every year for many years. But if you&#x2019;re 30 or 40, you can save a smaller percentage. Even if you&#x2019;ve been saving regularly, you might be surprised by just how much you&#x2019;ll need&#x2014;�especially when you factor in health-�care costs. To see if you&#x2019;re on track, see Question 1. If you&#x2019;re confused about which retirement account is best for you, see Question 4.<br><br>At a Glance: How Much Should You Be Saving?<br><br>Age you start saving% salary you need to save<br><br>20s10&#x2013;�15%<br><br>30s15&#x2013;�25%<br><br>40s25&#x2013;�40%<br><br>50s40% or more<br><br>The benefit of these guidelines is that once you start to save, the percentage won&#x2019;t change as you get older. The person who starts to put away 12% for retirement when she&#x2019;s 25 will never have to save more than 12% of her income. And unfortunately, if you wait too long to start saving, you&#x2019;re just setting yourself up for failure. You may not be in a position to save enough, so you&#x2019;ll have to adjust your expectations. Starting early is a huge advantage.<br><br>saving fundamentals: What Should You Save for First?<br><br>One of the hardest things about saving is figuring out where your money should go first. The Schwab Center for Financial Research has developed these eight Savings Fundamentals to help you prioritize and make the most of your savings dollars.<br><br>1.Contribute enough to your company retirement plan to take full advantage of your employer match<br><br>2.Pay down high-�interest consumer debt<br><br>3.Build an emergency fund<br><br>4.Maximize retirement savings<br><br>5.Save for a child&#x2019;s education<br><br>6.Save for a home<br><br>7.Pay down other debt<br><br>8.Keep investing<br><br>To make it easier on yourself, follow the first four fundamentals in order. Complete the final four according to your personal priorities and situation. But above all, save, save, save!<br><br>6. Automate Your Finances<br><br>Do you have your monthly bills on auto-�pay? How about your savings? Don&#x2019;t stop with the automatic contributions to your 401(k). Set up automatic monthly payments to your IRA and savings or brokerage accounts as well. You can even take it a step further by directing your savings automatically into a mutual fund or exchange-�traded fund.<br><br>7. Check In with Your Portfolio<br><br>When was the last time you took a close look at your portfolio? Market ups and downs can have a real effect on the percentage of stocks and bonds you own&#x2014;�even when you don&#x2019;t do a thing. Without over�doing it, it&#x2019;s smart to pay attention. If your investments don&#x2019;t reflect your current goals and feelings about risk, it&#x2019;s time to rejigger (in investment language, this is known as changing your asset allocation, or rebalancing). For ideas on how to invest, see Question 5, page 45.<br><br>Talk to an Expert. Think of a financial advisor like a personal trainer. If you know you&#x2019;ll need someone to help you get your finances in shape, an organization such as the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (napfa.org) can help you find a reputable advisor in your area. Also, see Question 6, page 76, for tips on choosing a financial advisor.<br><br>8. Review Your Insurance<br><br>We all need health insurance, and many of us also need car insurance as well as either homeowner&#x2019;s or renter&#x2019;s insurance. For some of us, a supplemental umbrella policy, disability insurance, life insurance, and professional liability coverage provide necessary and important coverage. Long-�term care insurance? Possibly. After that, tread very carefully. Mortgage insurance, life insurance for a child, pet insurance, travel insurance, wedding insurance, and a host of other specialized policies are often a waste of money. See Questions 7, 16, 17, and 27 for more.<br><br>Decide If You Need Long-�Term Care Insurance (LTCI)<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;ll need long-�term care&#x2014;�and therefore LTCI&#x2014;�depends a lot on your own health and family history. But according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 70 percent of people turning 65 can expect to use some form of long-�term care during their lives. About 20 percent will need it for longer than five years. What if you&#x2019;re one of the 20 percent? What would you do? If you have family to care for you, that might minimize your need for LTCI. If you have considerable assets, you might be able to pay for care out of pocket. Someone with a low net worth might qualify for long-�term care provided under Medicaid. However, if none of the above fits you, see Question 7, page 83 for more help.<br><br>Smart Move: Don&#x2019;t wait too long to explore long-�term care insurance. It&#x2019;s generally most cost-�effective to purchase a policy between the ages of 50 and 65, provided that you&#x2019;re in good health.<br><br>9. Create or Update Your Estate Plan<br><br>If you don&#x2019;t have a will, make this a priority, especially if you have children who would need a guardian. Also check that the beneficiaries on your retirement accounts and insurance policies are up-�to-�date. Make sure you have an advance health-�care directive and assign powers of attorney for both finances and health care. Consider a revocable living trust as a way of avoiding probate. To get started, see Question 38, page 299. Note: Estate planning is not a do-�it-�yourself activity. Even if your situation is pretty straightforward, it&#x2019;s best to consult with an estate planning attorney.<br><br>10. Organize Your Records<br><br>A simple financial organization system will help you keep everything else on track. First, take a look at your record keeping. Do you know where all of your important documents and statements are? Could you streamline by keeping some records electronically? Next, make a list of all your accounts and where they&#x2019;re located. Consider consolidating to make things simpler. Also make a list of your advisors, with names and contact information. Finally, put important dates on your calendar, that is, estimated taxes, property taxes, and any required minimum distributions from retirement accounts. For more, see Question 11, page 114.<br><br>Smart Move: Keep My Top Ten Financial Recommendations as a handy checklist and refer to them periodically to stay on track and measure your progress.<br><br>Important Disclosure<br><br>Rebalancing and asset allocation cannot ensure a profit, do not protect against losses, and do not guarantee that an investor&#x2019;s goal will be met.<br><br>Part I<br><br>When Retirement Is at Least Ten Years Out<br><br>As we start to contemplate retirement, partial retirement, intermittent retirement, or whatever arrangement we choose, perhaps the biggest challenge is being able to picture our future selves. It&#x2019;s hard to look into the future and imagine how we will feel and how we will want to live our lives. And some of the answers are unknowable. How long will we live? Will we be healthy? Will we want or be able to work? Will we want to live in the same house and will we have the same interests?<br><br>Answering these types of questions with complete accuracy isn&#x2019;t possible. And some people may think that it&#x2019;s a waste of time. But the more we think about these issues, the more likely we are to prepare financially. And that gives us more choices down the road.<br><br>As you go through this process, it&#x2019;s essential to keep the lines of communication open&#x2014;�with your spouse or partner and other family members, with your closest friends, and perhaps with financial and other professional advisors. Talking about things makes it real. It is also the best way I know of to evaluate your choices from different angles and make smart decisions.<br><br>This section identifies the core financial issues that you should consider as you plan for retirement that is approximately a decade out: How much should I be saving? Which retirement accounts make the most sense? How should I invest? What should I expect from a financial advisor? By understanding your choices and doing some calculations now, you are laying the foundation for a rewarding and secure future.<br><br>Q1.<br><br>I&#x2019;m saving for retirement&#x2014;�but how much is enough?<br><br>When you hear various projections about how much money it takes to retire comfortably&#x2014;�$1 million, $2 million, maybe more&#x2014;�it can take your breath away. And it can be downright discouraging. But before you throw your hands up in despair, realize that, like so much in financial planning, how much is enough for you depends on a lot of personal factors. For instance, will you live a quiet life in a small town or do you plan to travel the world? Will you really call it quits and retire completely or will you keep your hand in with a little part-�time work?<br><br>Fact: According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, in 2013 the percentage of workers confident of having enough money for a comfortable retirement was at a record low. While more than half expressed some level of confidence, 28 percent were not at all confident, and 21 percent were not too confident. And only 46 percent reported they and/or their spouse had tried to calculate how much money they will need to have saved by the time they retire so that they can live comfortably in retirement.<br><br>While you may not have precise answers now, with a little imagination and a bit of forward thinking you can get a good sense of how much you&#x2019;ll need. You&#x2019;ll want to determine three things:<br><br>�What you expect to spend each year<br><br>�How much money you&#x2019;ll need in your portfolio to support that spending<br><br>�How much more you have to save to get there<br><br>Start by Projecting What You&#x2019;re Likely to Spend<br><br>Will you spend less in retirement? The same? Opinions differ. Many people believe that their expenses will decline dramatically once they&#x2019;re retired, and in previous generations that may have been true. But today, people are living longer, they&#x2019;re healthy, and they want to continue to lead busy, active lives. That takes money.<br><br>When we look at national statistics, retired households spend about 80 percent of what working households spend. Most of that goes to home-�related and health costs. Statistics also show that spending tends to decline with age, especially as we get into our eighties or nineties. That makes sense and, in general, would seem to imply that you&#x2019;ll need less money in retirement than you live on today. Of course, this may also be because you simply don&#x2019;t...</p><h2>Elian McCready&#39;s Needlepoint</h2><p>As one of Ehrman Tapestry's best-selling designers, Elian McCready's work is colorful and larger than life, yet beautifully subtle.

Wallhangings, cushions, stools and even slippers and waistcoats are included in this collection of her designs. Peonies and hollyhocks, cockerels and cats, pansies and irises, roses and Flemish florals, pineapples and pears - all appear in the vibrant hues so synonymous with McCready&#39;s name. Gloriously presented in full colour throughout, the patterns are clearly illustrated and explained together with photographs of the finished result. An introduction to each project by McCready herself gives her thoughts on the subjects and the inspiration behind them. A short synopsis of techniques is included at the rear, again clearly illustrated and succinctly pertinent.. More aimed at experienced needlepersons, this would make a wonderful gift for lovers of McCready&#39;s designs and Ehrman tapestries.

Considerable recent interest has been focused on the role of goddesses in ancient societies, though not always with a clear eye on the actual source material. This book, written by one of the leading scholars of Celtic myth and religion, examines the significance of the female in Celtic belief and ritual as expressed in surviving archaeological remains and written sources.<br>Divine and semi-divine females abound in Welsh and Irish myths, often associated with themes of virginity and sexuality, promiscuity and destruction. The concept of partnership is a prominent aspect of Celtic religion and myth, and it is possible to trace evidence of the divine marriage in both European iconography and Irish myth. Interestingly, the female is sometimes the dominant partner.<br>Terrifying battle goddesses were invoked in times of war, often believed to change into raven-form as harbingers of death. A Mother Goddess was venerated, often in triple form, and supplicated for fertility of animals and crops. Goddesses were often linked with animals: birds, dogs, bears, pigs and snakes all had their divine protectresses. The great Celtic horse-goddess Epona even had a Roman festival dedicated to her. The transition from polytheistic paganism to monotheistic Christianity in the Celtic west is examined in a final chapter.</p><p>Dr Miranda Green is a Senior Lecturer in Archaeology and Early Celtic Studies at the University of Wales and a Course Tutor in Classical Studies at the Open University in Wales.</p><h2>TOTALLY WIRED</h2><p>"Totally Wired" features 32 interviews with the era's most innovative musicians and colourful personalities. From Ari Up, Jah Wobble, David Byrne, Green Gartside, Edwyn Collins, it also includes conversations with the most influential of label bosses, managers, record producers, deejays and journalists - such as John Peel and Paul Morley. Crackling with argument and anecdote, these conversations bring a rich human dimension to the post-punk story and its exceptional characters, from their earliest days to their glorious and sometimes disastrous musical adventures. Along with interviews, we get 'overviews': further reflections by Simon Reynolds on post-punk's key icons and crucial scenes, including John Lydon and Public Image Ltd, Ian Curtis and Joy Division, and the lineage of glam grotesquerie running from Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees to the New Romantics to Leigh Bowery.</p><p></p><h2>The New Grand Strategy: Restoring America&#39;s Prosperity, Security, and Sustainability in the 21st Century</h2><p><p><i>The New Grand Strategy</i> tells the story of a plan, born within the Pentagon, to recapture America&#x2019;s greatness at home and abroad by elevating sustainability as our new strategic imperative. It aligns our enduring national interests of prosperity and security with a new framework that addresses pressing economic, social, and environmental issues at home, tapping into a trillion-dollar market demand for walkable communities, regenerative agriculture and resource productivity. It is an inspiring vision of what&#x2019;s possible when Americans hold a collective view of the future and come together to bring it to reality.</p><p>This is no idealistic pipe dream or wonky policy prescription. The story that unfolds in this book weaves together hard-nosed economic analysis, a clear-eyed study of demographic and societal shifts, the realities of climate change and resource scarcity, a risk-based assessment of America&#x2019;s challenges and opportunities, and on-the-ground reporting of how much this is already unfolding throughout the country. By rediscovering the power and discipline of grand strategy&#x2015;and taking responsibility for our future&#x2015;America can reimagine the American dream and once again take on &#x201c;the cause of all mankind.&#x201d;</p><p>Released during one of America&#x2019;s most divisive presidential election campaigns, <i>The New Grand Strategy </i>avoids the partisan rhetoric dividing our nation today.

Mykleby, Doherty, and Makower have developed a pragmatic, actionable, long-term strategy that taps into what is best about America. In so doing, they&#x2019;re giving us, as a nation of citizens, the opportunity to move past the politics, cynicism, and apathy that are holding us back so we can get on with the hard work of reinventing America for our kids and grandkids.<b>&#x2015;Admiral Mike Mullen (RET.), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2007-11</b></p><p>Over time, America's soft power is more consequential around the world than our military might. Our soft power is linked profoundly to whether we are truly that shining city on a hill, admired for our freedom and the well-being of our people and the care we take for our children and future generations on this planet. <i>The New Grand Strategy</i> looks honestly at the sea of troubles in which America now finds itself, and, not stopping there, it charts an ambitious course to a better place.

This is not one of them. The confluence of internal and external factors has resulted in a defining moment for America &#x2015; today &#x2015; and we must act. The New Grand Strategy is the best blueprint I have seen for capturing and maximizing this moment. It offers us a clear, coherent and deeply compelling narrative to carry us thru the complexities we are facing. It is a fully actionable strategy that will allow America to adapt, compete, grow and evolve in a manner in line with our national values that transcend generations.

Kennedy</h2><p>Published to coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of his assassination, this memoir, compiled by Robert Kennedy&#39;s youngest son, contains stirring and compassionate writings recorded in the slain politician&#39;s personal journals throughout the 1960s. 50,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, collaborated on a daybook project in which they would jot down passages from their reading that moved them in some way. RFK continued the project after his brother's death in 1963, and would frequently use the quotations in it as source material for his speeches. <p> Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, Robert's youngest son, has drawn upon that journal, as well as material from his father's speeches, to create a unique portrait of RFK's spirit and character. In addition to his own powerful testimony to his passion for social justice, we learn that Robert Kennedy was able to learn as much about the meaning of freedom and justice from Albert Camus as he was from Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln. The concern with civil rights, pacifism, and America's role in the international arena (among other issues) that permeate Kennedy's thoughts are as relevant today as they were in the 1960s. <i>Make Gentle the Life of This World</i> is a stirring reminder of one of this century's strongest political visions.</p>Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy (November 20, 1925&#x2013;June 6, 1968), also called RFK, was an American statesman. He was United States Attorney General from 1961 to 1964 and a United States Senator from New York from 1965 until his assassination in 1968. He was one of the younger brothers of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and also one of his most trusted advisers, working closely with the president during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also made a significant contribution to the African-American Civil Rights Movement. After his brother's November 1963 assassination, Kennedy continued as Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson for nine months. He resigned in September 1964 and was elected to the United States Senate from New York that November. He broke with Johnson over the Vietnam War, among other issues. After Eugene McCarthy nearly defeated Johnson in the New Hampshire primary in early 1968, Kennedy announced his own campaign for president, seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party. Kennedy defeated McCarthy in the critical California primary but was shot shortly after midnight of June 5, 1968, dying on June 6. On June 9, President Johnson assigned security staff to all Presidential candidates and declared an official day of national mourning in response to the public grief following Kennedy's death.</p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 32</h2><p>Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens.

And the most magical of all are the beloved, venerable words of Mother Goose. Now folklorist Iona Opie has gathered more than sixty treasured rhymes in their most perfect, honest form. From "Hey Diddle, Diddle" and "Pat-a-Cake" to "Little Jack Horner" and "Pussycat, Pussycat," these are familiar verses that have been passed from parent to child for generations; these are the rhymes that are every child's birthright.<br><br>With watercolors by Rosemary Wells that may prove equally enduring, MY VERY FIRST MOTHER GOOSE captures the simple joy and the sly humor that are the essence of Mother Goose. Parents and children will find themselves exploring this volume together, savoring delightful details and funny surprises on every page. This is a book that promises hours of quiet smiles and merry grins for readers of all ages.</p><p>There should be a law that requires every child to sit on Grandpa's knee as he chants "Trot, trot, to Boston; trot, trot, to Lynn." Grownups who still giggle at the thought of Little Jack Horner pulling a plum out of his Christmas pie, or who make a wish on a star, murmuring "Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight" know the secret. They're the ones who will be handing down those same nursery rhymes to their own children, preserving an age-old tradition. But no child should be left behind.<p> In world folklore authority Iona Opie's collection, these invaluable and ancient nuggets of childhood verse are bursting with new life. Quirky and sly, sweet, gentle, rollicking, silly... the range of rhymes is breathtaking. Winner of over a dozen prestigious awards, including a Parents' Choice Award and an ALA Notable Children's Book award, this wonderful book is charmingly illustrated by Rosemary Wells, best known for her Max books (<i>Max's Bath</i>, <i>Max's Bedtime</i>, <i>Max's Ride</i>). A solid repertoire of nursery rhymes should be de rigueur for any aunt, uncle, grandparent, or parent worth his or her salt.

"I suppose my message in life is 'Nursery rhymes are good for you.' And the sooner you start, the better. I always have one myself every morning. I just open a nursery rhyme book at random. This morning I read:<br> Taffy was born on a<br> moonshiney night.<br><br> His head in a pipskin,<br> his heels upright.<br><br>You see, if you acquire a nursery rhyme-ical attitude, you're not at all put out by life's little bumps and bruises&#x2014;they just seem funny and entirely normal."<br>Rosemary Wells says, "We live in a time when our language is shrinking. Mother Goose, which represents our language at its most innocent, playful, and profound, is in danger of disappearing completely. Rhymes that have been repeated and refined for forty generations are no longer being taught to children. It is a great honor to work with Iona Opie with the hope of preserving these rhymes for many generations more."

Man has survived for as many as ninety days without food, but man can live very few minutes without oxygen and only a few days without water. This is the irony of nature. Man can scarcely exist for 72 hours without water before going into a semi-comatose state, but it is water itself that, in most forms, is the very substance which brings about the ultimate aging of man as well as lesser animals. It not only causes premature aging, but while living, man can suffer from hundreds of conditions brought on by drinking water saturated with magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate and other inorganic minerals. This book unlocks the mysteries of why man and animals die long before their time.

But the Pacific Ocean, where some of the story takes place, was a mystery. Some geographers thought there must be an undiscovered continent somewhere in its lonely reaches. Explorers and sailors who came back from the Pacific wrote vivid tales of their voyages and claimed to have seen strange cultures and fantastic animals, such as unicorns, griffins and giant eagles.

The character was created for British television in the 1970s by John Mortimer, who once said that he'd continue writing Rumpole tales only so long as actor Leo Kern could portray him on the tube. If Kern's death in July 2002 means that <i>Rumpole Rests His Case</i> is the beginning of the end, then at least this series concludes on a high and humorous note.<p> The seven yarns collected here find the rumpled Rumpole defending his usual assortment of eccentric clients, while also fending off antismoking zealots, interior designers with a taste for lava lamps, and his domineering wife, Hilda ("known to me only as She Who Must Be Obeyed"). One story teams the elderly advocate with an elusive Afghan doctor who was smuggled into the U.K. in a crate of mango chutney, and now seeks to become a legal resident. In another, Rumpole investigates an assault, apparently committed by an unmanageable teenager with a poetic streak, while a third case has the barrister working for a hypocritical right-wing politician who, after first seducing away the wife of one of Rumpole's colleagues, is accused of a drug offense. Cleverest of all, though, is the title tale, in which a hospital-confined Rumpole builds the defense for one of his roommates, a "reformed" thief with an unlikely connection to the aged major who shot him during a residential break-in. With his own unreformed taste for claret and cheroots, Rumpole persists in being an entertaining, old-fashioned thorn in the silk-covered side of Britain's judicial system. Could somebody please tell Mortimer that it's too soon for this character to hang up his wig? <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.</p><h2>Torah of the Earth Vol 2: Exploring 4,000 Years of Ecology in Jewish Thought: Zionism &amp; Eco-Judaism</h2><p><p><b>Can we re-imagine our relationship to the earth&#x2015;using the<br>viewpoints and texts of the last four millennia? </b></p><p>Human responses to the natural world stretching back through the last 4,000 years come to life in this major new resource providing a diverse group of ecological and religious voices.

How is it that so many seemingly intelligent organizations implement harmful management practices and ideas? In his provocative new book, <i>The Human Equation</i>, bestselling author Jeffrey Pfeffer examines why much of the current conventional wisdom is wrong and asks us to re-think the way managers link people with organizational performance. Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectively&#x2014;not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices. Filled with information and ideas, <i>The Human Equation</i> provides much-needed guidance for managing people more wisely and more profitably.</p><p>The lure of new and profitable markets has lead many companies to formulate strategies to capture these markets. This focus on strategy often leads to downsizing and the shedding of old businesses in favor of a "lean" economic model that stresses outsourcing. The strategy that leads to downsizing has its short-term rewards--a fatter bottom line and happy shareholders. <p>Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that much of this downsizing is nothing more than a throwback to 100-year-old employment practices. Instead of cutting costs as a means to increase profits, companies should focus more on building revenue by relying on solid people-management skills. Through dozens of examples, Pfeffer demonstrates that successful companies worry more about people and the competence in their organizations than they do about having the right strategy. Pfeffer contends that the strategy part is relatively easy--it's the day-to-day execution that's hard. Companies that understand the relationship between people and profits are the ones that usually win in the long run.</p>"<i>The Human Equation</i> is simplicity itself. Jeffrey Pfeffer shows that organizations that support, encourage, and build the skills of their people outperform all competitors. The power of committed minds and hearts working toward a common goal wins today and builds for tomorrow." --Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO, The Drucker Foundation <p>"Jeffrey Pfeffer's grasp of what makes companies successful moves us beyond the anecdotes to the facts. He tells us what the wise already know: People aren't a commodity to be acquired or sold. Rather, they are the fuel that drives the commerce of business." --James P. Hackett, President and CEO, Steelcase, Inc. </p><p>"For managers who already treat their personnel as the key factor in their company's economic success, <i>The Human Equation</i> confirms this policy. For skeptics, the book poses a challenge to change their strategy for managing people effectively." --Professor Dr. Walter Kunerth, Former Executive Vice President, Siemens AG </p><p>"My experience--both in and outside the business world--supports Pfeffer's view that effective leadership of the whole team is critical for sustained, profitable growth. Pfeffer has created a compelling path of logic, with lots of examples, to link people with profits and above-average people management with above-average performance. I recommend this book to business leaders at all levels." --H. A. Wagner, President and CEO, Air Products &amp; Chemicals </p><p>"Bravo! Jeff Pfeffer illustrates the fact that although most companies say 'people are our most important asset,' only an enlightened few actually do put a positive focus on their employees. Through a strong case of facts, he converts what many consider a 'soft' subject to a 'hard' one, and he proves that a people-based strategy truly is a competitive advantage." --Sheryl L. Bartolucci, Executive Vice President, Bank of America</p></p><h2>Kitchen Creamery: Making Yogurt, Butter &amp; Cheese at Home</h2><p>As the DIY movement continues to gain momentum, it's no wonder home cheesemaking is the next hot topic.

But, alas, the prince&#x2019;s gathering proves disastrous when the mutilated body of a prostitute turns up in a linen closet among the queen&#x2019;s monogrammed sheets. <br><br>With great haste, Thomas Pitt, brilliant mainstay of Special Services, is summoned to resolve the crisis. The Pitts&#x2019; cockney maid, Gracie, is also recruited to pose as a palace servant and listen in on the guests&#x2019; conversations. If Pitt and Gracie fail to find out who brutally murdered the young woman, Pitt&#x2019;s career will be over, and the scandal may just cause the monarchy to fall.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the William Monk novels, including <b>Dark Assassin </b>and <b>The Shifting Tide</b>, and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <b>Buckingham Palace Gardens </b>and <b>Long Spoon Lane</b>.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.Chapter One<br><br>She was apparently found in the linen cupboard, poor creature,&#x201d; Narraway replied, his lean face dour, his eyes so dark they seemed black in the interior shadow of the hansom cab. Then, before Pitt could say anything further, he corrected himself. &#x201c;One of the linen cupboards in Buckingham Palace. It was a particularly brutal murder.&#x201d;<br><br>The vehicle jerked forward, throwing Pitt back in the seat. &#x201c;A prostitute?&#x201d; he said incredulously.<br><br>Narraway was silent for a moment. The horse&#x2019;s hoofs clattered loudly, the carriage&#x2019;s wheels rattling over the cobbles dangerously close to the pavement edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Surely that&#x2019;s a bad joke!&#x201d; he said at last as they swung around the corner into The Mall and picked up speed again.<br><br>&#x201c;Very bad,&#x201d; Narraway agreed. &#x201c;At least I hope so. But I fear it is perfectly serious. However, if Mr. Cahoon Dunkeld proves to be wasting our time exercising his sense of humor, I shall take great joy in personally putting him in jail&#x2014;preferably one of our less pleasant ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It has to be a joke,&#x201d; Pitt said, shivering at the thought. &#x201c;There couldn&#x2019;t be a murder at the Palace. How could a prostitute get in there, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Through the door, exactly as we shall, Pitt,&#x201d; Narraway answered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be na�ve. And she was probably more welcome than we shall be.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt felt a little stung. &#x201c;Who is Cahoon Dunkeld?&#x201d; he asked, avoiding looking at Narraway. He had a reverence for Queen Victoria, especially now in her advanced age and widowhood, even though he was perfectly well aware of her reputed eccentricities and the fact that she had not always been so popular with her people. She had been in mourning too long, retreating not only from joy but also from duty. And he had gained some personal knowledge a couple of years ago of the extravagance and the self-indulgence of the Prince of Wales, and knew he kept several very expensive mistresses. Pitt had been superintendent of Bow Street then, and the conspiracy around the Prince had cost him his job and very nearly brought down the throne. That was why Pitt was now working for Victor Narraway in Special Branch, learning more about treason, anarchy, and other forms of violence against the State.<br><br>But the thought of a prostitute in the Queen&#x2019;s home was different. It disgusted him, and he had difficulty concealing it, even though he knew Narraway found him plebeian amd faintly amusing for having such idealism.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is Cahoon Dunkeld?&#x201d; he repeated.<br><br>Narraway leaned forward a little. The dappled, early-morning sunlight of The Mall made bright patterns on the road. There was little traffic. It was not a residential area, and such horseback riders as were out would be cantering up and down Rotten Row on the edge of Hyde Park.<br><br>&#x201c;An adventurer of considerable charm when he wishes, and undoubted ability, who is now seeking to become a gentleman in the more recognized social sense,&#x201d; Narraway answered. &#x201c;And apparently a friend of His Royal Highness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is he doing at the Palace at this hour of the morning?&#x201d; Pitt said.<br><br>&#x201c;That is what we are about to find out,&#x201d; Narraway snapped as they came out of The Mall in front of the Palace. The magnificent wrought-iron railings were tipped with gold. Guards were on duty wearing bearskin helmets, their red tunics bright in the sun.<br><br>Pitt looked up at the sweeping fa�ade itself and then at the roof. He saw with a flood of relief that there was no flag flying, indicating that Her Majesty was not in residence. At the same time he was inexplicably disappointed. He was quite aware that Narraway would find it gauche of him, but Pitt would like to have caught another glimpse of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. In spite of all common sense, there was a quickening of his heartbeat. Even inside the hansom cab he sat straighter, lifted his chin a little, and squared his shoulders.<br><br>If Narraway noticed, he did not allow himself even the slightest smile.<br><br>They swung round to the right, heading for the entrance where tradesmen and deliveries would go. They were stopped at the gate. Narraway gave his name, and immediately the guard stepped back and saluted. The cabdriver, startled into respect, urged his horse forward at a newly dignified pace.<br><br>Ten minutes later Pitt and Narraway were being conducted up the wide, elegant stairs by a manservant who had introduced himself as Tyndale. He was of slight build but he moved with suppleness, even some grace, although Pitt judged him to be well into his fifties. He was courteous enough, but quite obviously distressed beyond any ability to maintain his normal composure.<br><br>At any other time Pitt would have been fascinated to think that he was inside Buckingham Palace. Now all he could think of was the enormity of what lay ahead of them. The magnificence of history meant nothing.<br><br>Was this an idiotic practical joke? Tyndale&#x2019;s pallid face and stiff shoulders said not, and for the first time since Narraway had made his extraordinary statement in the hansom, Pitt considered the possibility that it might be true.<br><br>They were at the top of the stairs. Tyndale walked across the landing and knocked on a door a little to the left. It was opened immediately by a man of much greater height than he, with broad shoulders and a dark face of remarkable dynamism. He was severely balding, but this in no way diminished his handsomeness. His gray hair must once have been black because his brows still were. His skin was burned by sun and wind to a deep bronze.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Narraway has arrived, Mr. Dunkeld,&#x201d; Tyndale said quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Dunkeld replied. &#x201c;Now please leave us, and make sure that we are not interrupted. In fact, see that no staff come up onto this floor at all.&#x201d; He turned to Narraway as if Tyndale was already gone. &#x201c;Narraway?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Narraway acknowledged it, and introduced Pitt.<br><br>&#x201c;Cahoon Dunkeld.&#x201d; The big man held out his hand and shook Narraway&#x2019;s briefly. He ignored Pitt except for a nod of his head. &#x201c;Come in, close the door.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and led the way into the charming, highly overfurnished room. Its wide, tall windows overlooked a garden, and beyond them the trees were motionless billows of green in the morning sun.<br><br>Dunkeld remained standing in the middle of the floor. He spoke solely to Narraway. &#x201c;There has been a shocking event. I have never seen anything quite so . . . bestial. How it should happen here, of all places, is beyond my comprehension.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me exactly what has happened, Mr. Dunkeld,&#x201d; Narraway responded. &#x201c;From the beginning.&#x201d;<br><br>Dunkeld winced, as if the memory were painful. &#x201c;From the beginning? I woke early. I . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Deliberately Narraway sat down in one of the large overstuffed chairs covered in wine-colored brocade. He crossed his legs elegantly, if a little rigidly, at the knees. &#x201c;The beginning, Mr. Dunkeld. Who are you, and why are you here at this hour of the morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake . . . !&#x201d; Dunkeld burst out. Then controlling himself with obvious difficulty, body stiff, he sat down also and began to explain. He had the air not of having grasped Narraway&#x2019;s reasoning so much as being given no choice but to humor a lesser intelligence. His fingers drummed on the arm of his chair.<br><br>&#x201c;His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, is deeply interested in an engineering project that may be undertaken by my company, and certain of my colleagues,&#x201d; he began again. &#x201c;Four of us are here at his invitation in order to discuss the possibilities&#x2014;the details, if you like. Our wives have accompanied us to give it the appearance of a social occasion. The other three are Julius Sorokine, Simnel Marquand, and Hamilton Quase. We have been here two days already, and the discussions have been excellent.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt remained on his feet, listening and watching Dunkeld&#x2019;s face. His expression was intense, his eyes burning with enthusiasm. His left hand, gripping the chair arm, was white at the knuckles.<br><br>&#x201c;Yesterday evening we celebrated our progress so far,&#x201d; Dunkeld continued. &#x201c;I assume you are a man of the world, and do not need to have every detail drawn for you? The ladies retired early. We sat up considerably longer, and a certain amount of entertainment was provided. The brandy was excellent, the company both relaxing and amusing. We were all in high spirits.&#x201d; Not once did he glance at Pitt as he spoke. He might have been as invisible as a servant.<br><br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Narraway answered expressionlessly.<br><br>&#x201c;We retired between one and two in the morning,&#x201d; Dunkeld went on. &#x201c;I awoke early&#x2014;about six, I imagine. I was in my robe, not yet dressed, when my valet came with a message that he had received over the telephone. It was a matter His Royal Highness had asked to be informed of immediately, so, in spite of the hour, I took it to him. I returned to my room, shaved and dressed, had a cup of tea, and was on my way back to see His Royal Highness further about the matter, but passing the linen cupboard in the passage I saw the door slightly open.&#x201d; His voice was harsh with tension. &#x201c;That in itself, of course, is of no interest, but I became aware of a curious odor, and when I pulled it wider . . . I saw . . . probably the most dreadful thing I have ever seen.&#x201d; He blinked and seemed to need a moment to compose himself again.<br><br>Narraway did not interrupt him, nor move his gaze from Dunkeld&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x201c;The naked body of a woman, covered in blood,&#x201d; Dunkeld said hoarsely. &#x201c;There was blood all over the rest of the linen.&#x201d; He gulped air. &#x201c;For a moment, I could not believe it. I thought I must have taken more brandy than I had imagined and become delirious. I don&#x2019;t know how long I stood there, leaning against the door frame. Then I backed into the corridor. There was no one else in sight.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I closed the door.&#x201d; Dunkeld seemed to find some comfort in remembering the act, as if he could at the same time close the horror from his inner vision. &#x201c;I called Tyndale, the man who called you. He is the principal manservant in this guest wing. I told him that one of the women from the previous evening had been found dead, that he must keep all servants from that corridor; serve breakfast to the other guests in their rooms. Then I asked for the telephone and called you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is His Royal Highness aware of this event?&#x201d; Narraway asked.<br><br>Dunkeld blinked. &#x201c;Naturally I had to inform him. He has given me full authority to act in his name and get this ghastly tragedy cleared up with the utmost haste, and absolute discretion. You cannot fail to be aware of the scandal it would cause if it became public.&#x201d; His eyes were hard, demanding, and the very slight lift in his voice suggested he needed reassurance of both Narraway&#x2019;s intelligence and his tact. &#x201c;Her Majesty will be returning next week, on her way from Osborne to travel north to Balmoral. It is imperative that your investigation is entirely accomplished before that time. Do you understand me?&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt felt his stomach knot, and suddenly there was barely enough air in the room for him to breathe. He had been here minutes, and yet he felt imprisoned.<br><br>He must have made a slight sound, because Dunkeld looked at him, then back at Narraway. &#x201c;What about your man here?&#x201d; he asked abruptly. &#x201c;How far can you trust his discretion? And his ability to handle such a vital matter? And it is vital. If it became public, it would be ruinous, even affect the safety of the realm. Our business here concerns a profoundly important part of the Empire. Not only fortunes but nations could be changed by what we do.&#x201d; He was staring at Narraway as if by sheer will he could force some understanding into him, even a fear of failure.<br><br>Narraway gave a very slight shrug. It was a minimal, elegant gesture of his shoulders. He was far leaner than Dunkeld, and more at ease in his beautifully tailored jacket. &#x201c;He is my best,&#x201d; he answered.<br><br>Dunkeld looked unimpressed. &#x201c;And discreet?&#x201d; he persisted.<br><br>&#x201c;Special Branch deals with secrets,&#x201d; Narraway told him.<br><br>Dunkeld&#x2019;s eyes turned to Pitt and surveyed him coolly.<br><br>Narraway rose to his feet. &#x201c;I would like to see the body,&#x201d; he announced.<br><br>Dunkeld took a deep breath and stood up also. He walked past Pitt and opened the door, leaving them to follow him. He led the way along the corridor with its ornately plastered and gilded ceiling, and up another broad flight of stairs. At the top he turned right past two doors to where a young footman stood at attention outside a third door.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice</h2><p>Scores of books and articles have been written in the popular press and mainstream marketplace about leadership: who leaders are, what they do, and why they matter. Yet in academia, there is a dearth of rigorous research, journal articles, or doctoral programs focused on leadership as a discipline. Why do top business schools espouse mission statements that promise to "educate the leaders of the future"- yet fail to give leadership its intellectual due?<br><br>The Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice seeks to bridge this disconnect. Based on the Harvard Business School Centennial Colloquium "Leadership: Advancing an Intellectual Discipline" and edited by HBS professors Nitin Nohria and Rakesh Khurana, this volume brings together the most important scholars from fields as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics, and history to take stock of what we know about leadership and to set an agenda for future research.<br><br>More than a means of getting ahead and gaining power, leadership must be understood as a serious professional and personal responsibility.

Read what he says here and remember it well. "The wisest man sometimes acts weakly, and the weakest man sometimes acts wisely."</em></p> <p><em>Your loving Grandmother,</em><br> <em>Lady Elder</em></p> <p>Was she late or simply not coming?</p> <p>Lucas Randolph Morgandale, the ninth Earl of Morgandale, sat in his book room with his booted feet propped on the Louis XIV writing desk. He sipped brandy from a glass that had been warmed by his hand and listened to the rain gently beat against the windowpane. The foul weather, the indulgent amount of drink he'd consumed, and the fact that the woman hadn't arrived had him feeling restless, much to his irritation.</p> <p>But it was more than the weather and the absent courtesan that had him in an ill humor. Morgan had watched both his cousins, Blake and Race, fall in love and marry during the London Season, and he had no intentions of falling prey to the same trap, despite their clever machinations over the past few weeks. In order to avoid any such confining pitfalls, he'd decided to quit the city early and spend the entire summer at his Valleydale estate in Dorset.</p> <p>The first couple of weeks, it had been easy for him to fill his days with endless paperwork, hunting, and working with his thoroughbred horses. Later in the summer he had taken the time to ride over the vast lands of all his holdings, visiting with each of his tenants and thanking them for their hard work and dedication. In the evenings, he had enjoyed gaming at the local tavern or attending one of the many house parties that were scheduled at various estates around the area.</p> <p>Still there was a void, an inexplicable feeling that something was missing in his life. Since a young lad, he had always enjoyed his stays at Valleydale, and he couldn't put his finger on what made this time different.</p> <p>Perhaps he had simply grown tired of the slower pace of country life. But every time he thought about going back to London, he remembered the knot of frustration over Blake's and Race's scheming in trying to show him how wonderful married life could be. He had told them on more than one occasion that he had no desire to be tied down by the bonds of matrimony.</p> <p>Gambling, drinking, riding, and all the other things he'd done had not completely distracted him from the fact that his two best friends, cousins at that, had married. And while both of them had done the proper thing and invited him to dinner often, it hadn't taken him long to realize that was half the problem. Every time he turned around, one of them was having him to dinner at their home with their wives and very conveniently happened to invite a string of uninspiring young ladies as well.</p> <p>He was tired of being entangled in their schemes. Morgan huffed under his breath and took another sip of the brandy, letting it settle on his tongue a few seconds before swallowing. They were mollycoddling him as if he couldn't find feminine companionship for himself</p> <p>He had to get away. He had to get away from them. London Society was fueled by gossip, and all the scandalmongers were laying bets he'd be married by the end of summer. Morgan had scoffed at that ridiculous notion as utterly preposterous. But it hadn't kept White's from making it an official wager, much to his consternation.</p> <p>Morgan would rather pay for his women so there would be no strings attached. But finding a suitable bedmate was obviously more easily planned than carried out so far from the City.</p> <p>It wasn't that there weren't plenty of women around willing to share their beds or to give him a few minutes of pleasure, but Morgan had realized a few months ago, when he was at Valleydale with his cousins, that a quick romp with an upstairs wench at the local tavern no longer held any appeal for him. And unlike his cousins, Blake and Race, Morgan had never cared for the idea of setting up a paid mistress in Town to be at his beck and call. Mistresses demanded time and attention that he wasn't willing to give.</p> <p>So in desperation, he supposed, he had come up with a grand plan to hire a woman never destined to be a wife to come and spend a couple of days with him at his estate; a beautiful, willing woman he could sink his flesh into with no strings attached, only relief.</p> <p>With the help of his solicitor, Buford Saint, Morgan had gone to great lengths to arrange for an exclusive and quite expensive lady of the evening to travel out via a private coach to see him. Saint had assured him she was highly sought after, and even Prinny himself had been known to enjoy her services from time to time.</p> <p>Morgan had a letter from Saint saying she would arrive this afternoon, but afternoon had turned to evening, and evening had become late night, and there still was no sign of Miss Francine Goodbody. When she hadn't made it by nine o'clock, and it was clear she wouldn't be taking supper with him, Morgan had sent his two house servants to bed. Since then, he had been in his book room drinking too much, as was evidenced by the pounding in his temples and the roar in his ears.</p> <p>He hated the feeling of not being quite in control of himself. That and the cursed headaches the next day were the reasons he'd fallen out of favor with drunkenness years ago. But tonight, for some damned reason, he had uncharacteristically given in to frustration and ended up feeling justified for overindulging in the fine brandy his cousin Blake had given him before he left London.</p> <p>While continuing to grumble over his unfortunate plight, Morgan heard a noise. A sharp sense of warning shimmied up his back for a second, and he regained control of himself instantly. Did he hear the sound of a carriage coming up the tree-lined drive that led to his house? Had the much-anticipated Miss Francine Goodbody finally arrived? As quietly as possible, he lowered his feet to the floor and placed the brandy glass on the edge of the desk. He rose, walked to the opposite side of the room, parted the sheers that covered the window, and looked out into the darkness.</p> <p>A dense fog had settled over the landscape, and rain fell in a steady stream. No one should be out in this downpour, but he was certain that he saw the lights from a coach coming up the lonely road that led to the front of his house.</p> <p><em>She had made it at last.</em></p></p><h2>Sunrise Behind the Louvre</h2><p>Features the adventures of private detective Nestor Burma.

He is Andrew Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University. In 1986 Elie Wiesel received the Nobel Peace Prize.In a loosely spun collection of legends about King Solomon, Nobel laureate Wiesel adopts a friendly, conversational styleAalmost as if he were spending a Shabbat afternoon regaling children with snippets of tales from the Talmud and Midrash. The angel Michael brings Solomon the ring of the title: "With it you will conquer all the demons of this world, and with their labor, you shall build the Temple of Jerusalem." Anecdotes tell how the king travels on a flying carpet; trades quips with ants and birds; unwisely takes the Pharaoh's daughter as one of his 1000 wives; gets tricked by Ashmedai, the king of the demons; etc. The narrative is fluid, with one episode easily giving way to the next. However, some readersAparticularly presiding adults unfamiliar with the roles of the Talmud and MidrashAmay wish the author had provided more of a context for his storytelling than is offered in the minimal source notes at the end. Podwal, previously paired with Wiesel for A Passover Haggadah, adheres to his customary style, eschewing clearly narrative visuals in favor of a series of almost mythic images. If Wiesel's text evokes the atmosphere of his Carpathian boyhood, Podwal's palette hints of the South of France, and his carefully modulated abstractions are as striking in their embrace of the 20th century as is the text's pleasure in tradition.

It is 1919, Russia is in the throes of revolution, the czarist army in retreat. Imperial China is in ruins, shattered into a horde of private kingdoms ruled by warlords. From Manchuria, Japanese, English and American forces manipulate what's left of the republic to satisfy their own conflicting interests. Acclaimed European cartoonist Pratt sends his celebrated creation Corto Maltese into this political caldron in search of adventure, love and an armored train loaded with czarist gold. Corto and his demented, mercurial ally, Rasputin, find themselves confronting one of the most lunatic generals of the White Army.

As the quintessential pop star of the 1980s, Boy George was constantly in the public eye, with a string of platinum Culture Club hits, sensational personal appearances, camp behavior and gender-bending dress that fueled the media's infatuation.

Filled with confession, revelation and inspiration, this book reflects the utter creativity of its author and tells the mesmerizing story of how George achieved the nearly impossible by coming back from the land of the deeply addicted to health, sobriety and a new horizon of musical success. His is an unfinished journey.</p>The British pop band Culture Club produced a string of mid-1980s hits like "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me" and "Karma Chameleon," but the provocative, campy persona of frontman Boy George always attracted more attention than the band's music itself. Characterized by his droll wit, elaborate makeup and bizarre, gender-bending dress, Boy George took pop-star iconography to new heights of outlandishness and was a worldwide media darling until his drug habit all but destroyed his career. In this highly entertaining autobiography, the singer details with wit and pathos his working-class childhood as the self-dubbed "pink sheep" of a large suburban family, his teenage fascination with and emulation of glam-rock icons like David Bowie and Marc Bolan, his years as a London punk scenester, his jet-setting life as a pop celebrity and his painful descent into and recovery from heroin addiction. At times rambling and disjointed, this is nevertheless a compelling portrait of an individual who, by publicly celebrating his kinks and quirks, parlayed his alienation from mainstream British culture into a highly successful career.

Has she done more harm than good?</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015:</strong> Intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won&#x2019;t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins&#x2019;s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think: <i>Hitchcockian</i>. From the opening line, the reader knows what they&#x2019;re in for: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks...&#x201d; But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran&#x2019;s finesse. The &#x201c;girl on the train&#x201d; is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees &#x201c;Jess&#x201d; kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character&#x2019;s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel&#x2019;s ex-husband&#x2019;s wife, who happens to be Jess/Megan&#x2019;s neighbor. Rachel&#x2019;s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan&#x2019;s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn&#x2019;t. This is a book to be devoured. <i>-Neal Thompson</i></p>PAULA HAWKINS has worked in journalism for ten years.

In between are chapters on Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, the marginalists, John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and Thorstein Veblen. The title expresses Duncan Foley&#x2019;s belief that economics at its most abstract and interesting level is a speculative philosophical discourse, not a deductive or inductive science. Adam&#x2019;s fallacy is the attempt to separate the economic sphere of life, in which the pursuit of self-interest is led by the invisible hand of the market to a socially beneficial outcome, from the rest of social life, in which the pursuit of self-interest is morally problematic and has to be weighed against other ends. </p><p> Smith and his successors argued that the market and the division of labor that is fostered by it result in tremendous gains in productivity, which lead to a higher standard of living. Yet the market does not address the problem of distribution&#x2014;that is, how is the gain in wealth to be divided among the classes and members of society? Nor does it address such problems as the long-run well-being of the planet. </p><p> <i>Adam&#x2019;s Fallacy</i> is beautifully written and contains interesting observations and insights on almost every page. It will engage the reader&#x2019;s thoughts and feelings on the deepest level. </p></p><p><b>Duncan K. Foley</b> is Leo Model Professor at the New School for Social Research.Foley gets deep into the analytical content of major schools of thought, ranking Adam's Fallacy up there with Heilbroner's classic. (Robert Solow <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2006-11-16)<br><br>So what is 'Adam's Fallacy?'...It is the idea that the economic sphere of life constitutes a separate realm 'in which the pursuit of self-interest is guided by objective laws to a socially beneficent outcome'...Professor Foley's book is simultaneously an introduction to economic theory and a critique of it. It is his version of the classic introduction for the economically challenged by Robert L. Heilbroner, <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i>, now in its seventh edition. <i>Adam's Fallacy</i> concentrates more on the worldly philosophies rather than on the philosophers, on economic theory rather than on the characters and events that along with Mr. Heilbroner's masterly storytelling gave <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> so much color and verve...By questioning economic theory's cordoning off of an economic spheres of life ruled by its own laws and expertise, Professor Foley is implicitly proposing limits to the secularization that is an underlying characteristic of modernity. Secularization has meant that in a cultural transformation, major areas of human activity set themselves up as quasi-autonomous, with their own standards, authorities, and guiding principles. (Peter Steinfels <i>New York Times</i> 2006-11-25)<br><br>[A] passionate book, to be welcomed in a discipline notably devoid of passion.

The negatives were left after his death, and by this accident of history, an extraordinary picture of a small town under the impact of the Great Depression has proved possible.</p><p>The last decade of the 19th century was, for some Americans, a time when great fortunes were to be made. For many others, however, the period was a time of economic dislocation, when the gap between city and countryside, rich and poor, grew ever wider. As the Indian Wars ended and the Gilded Age extended into America's first Imperial Age, social critics such as Mark Twain and William Dean Howells began to examine the dark side of the American dream: violence, poverty, degenerate behavior, suicide, and insanity.<p> In the late 1960s, another desperate time, historian Michael Lesy took a long look at fin-de-si�cle America. Examining a collection of several thousand glass plate negatives and historical documents from Jackson County, Wisconsin, he concocted a sprawling treatise on a past that had been willfully forgotten, a brooding rejoinder to Edgar Lee Masters's <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>. First published in 1973, Lesy's <i>Wisconsin Death Trip</i>, now reissued in a handsome paperbound edition, became a key text of the counterculture, a book to shelve alongside <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i> and <i>Custer Died for Your Sins</i>--and it sometimes reads like a hip product of its time. Lesy documents the unsettling record of one small corner of rural America, turning up accounts of barn burnings, attacks by gangs of armed tramps, threatening and obscene letters, death by diphtheria and smallpox (the Wisconsin townsfolk had, some years, to attend several funerals a week), alcoholism, madness, business and bank failures, and even a case or two of witchcraft.</p><p> After reading Lesy's texts and viewing the sometimes unsettling images he's turned up, you would be forgiven for thinking that no one in small-town Wisconsin in our great-great-grandparents' time was well-adjusted--which is, of course, not the case. Hyperbole notwithstanding, this is a remarkable study, one that Lesy himself rightly calls an experiment in both history and alchemy. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Wisconsin Death Trip is the subject of a forthcoming Cinemax Reel Life documentary scheduled to air in summer 2000.</p><h2>More Food From Your Garden</h2><p>In this compact volume the author presents a concise look on growing fresh vegetables to meet the needs of the family with a surplus to share or sell - is the outgrowth of many years of research and experimentation im more than two score countries around the world under most unusual and varied circumstances, most recently in Africa, Southern Utah Indian reservations, Trinidad, Tobago, W.I, and Russia. <p>After these years of research a simple garden method has been perfected.

Franchise arrangements also produced these in Europe and South Africa. </p><p>To speed delivery of his plants, he developed Magic Mitts, a new method of growing, packaging, and delivering plants and flowers through a nation-wide retail chain. </p><p>During these years he conquered weeds, harmful insects, and plant diseases and perfected a technique for making soil produce near-perfect plants and flowers in budget-balancing abundance. </p><p>In 1964, he closed his successful nursery business and decided to live on his modest annuity so he could devote his remaining years to serving mankind in the field of scientific food production. He was an instructor in the Extension Faculty of Loma Linda University and has been an International Agricultural Consultant and given extensive instruction and successful vegetable-gardening demonstrations in many locations throughout the U. S. A. and Canada, as well as New Guinea, Fiji, Okinawa, the Philippines, Trinidad (West Indies), Mexico, Honduras, Guyana, and Africa. From 1989 to 1996 he conducted season-long gardening courses in Russia, helping those people increase their food crops from 4 (cabbage, potatoes, beets, and carrots) to 23. His gardening books have been translated into Russian, Japanese, and Spanish. </p><p>During the time he was teaching in the developing countries, Dr. Mittleider was honored with two Doctorate degrees - one from Florida Beacon College, and the other from Timorazi University in Moscow, Russia (reputedly the most prestigious school in the Russian Commonwealth). </p><p>For the past 3 years Dr. Mittleider has been a consultant at Thanksgiving Point in Lehi, Utah, supervising the planting and growth of the lawns, trees, and shrubs. He also established an extensive vegetable-garden show-place and supervised and taught gardening classes there. He and his wife, Mildred, are currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>"I have been completely converted by the simplicity and soundness of the system and above all the results . . . Dr. Mittleider, no matter how short or how long your stay in this country you have lit a torch which will burn for a long time." (C.D. Promnitz, Agricultural Officer, Zimbabwe, Africa) <p>I am pleased to write concerning our experience using the Mittleider Method of growing a large variety of fresh vegetables for the L.D.S. Welfare System . . . My personal feelings and those shared by my associates are, that the Mittleider Method is a most enjoyable means of growing food . . . The results are fantastically more rewarding than I have ever had in my 30 years of growing vegetables by conventional means. The production is heavier, quality higher, and the results more dramatic in every way. I am pleased to recommend the Mittleider Method to everyone for pleasure or profit. (President Charles A. Jones, Sandy, Utah Central Stake, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) </p><p>Dr. Mittleider knows one thing that can change the face of the earth, and he's trying to get someone to listen. No matter how poor man, or man's soil is, if there's a way to get water to it, with only a plot of ground 20' X 100', a man can feed his family better than it has ever been fed before . . . He has proven his claims in just about every type of adverse situation in the world . . . The Idaho baker-turned-agricultural wizard, specializes in turning what is known as "devil-land" into unbelievably productive land. The beauty of the program is that the transformation can take place anywhere from three to six months, with food to spare and to share for the effort . . . There's no reason why there is a single person in the world who has to go to bed hungry. -- <i>Dr. William Willoughby, National Courier Correspondent</i></p></p><h2>Sorcery!

Silence in this sense is not only a quality of the environment, but primarily an attitude, an attitude of listening. ... Let us give to one another that gift of silence, so that we can listen together and listen to one another. Only in this silence will we be able to hear that gentle breath of peace, that music to which the spheres dance, that universal harmony to which we, too, hope to dance."<br><br> Austrian-born Benedictine monk David Steindl-Rast is one of the most influential and beloved spiritual teachers of our time.

Piers Anthony lives in Inverness, Florida.1<br>IDEA<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Picka Bone asked, startled. His bone head was hollow, but this was normal for a walking skeleton, and he could see, hear, and think well enough. Magical creatures were not handicapped in the manner of mortal ones; they were not subject to the ills of flesh. As it happened, they were just completing their hourly tour of the cemetery they were patrolling.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a living cat,&#x201d; his sister Joy&#x2019;nt said. She was his age, twenty-four, with nice bones. &#x201c;With a bird sitting on his head.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought it was. Don&#x2019;t live cats normally eat live birds?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Normally,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt agreed. &#x201c;There may be an interesting story here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And we could use some interest in our dull routine.&#x201d; For that was a liability of their state: terminal dullness. Without the fear of pain or death, they seldom got exited. Intellectual interest was about all that sustained them, and they were not great intellects.<br>The cat was coming directly toward them. It was a nondescript male with blond fur, evidently mundane. The little bird was flapping its wings but not flying, as if trying to get their attention. It was a male parakeet with brownish feathers, another mundane creature. They halted right before the skeletons.<br>Joy&#x2019;nt had a soft spot for animals, figuratively, as none of her was physically soft. She squatted and extended her bone hand to the cat to sniff. &#x201c;What can we do for you, strange feline?&#x201d; she inquired.<br>The cat scratched in the sand, smoothing it. Then he stroked a claw across it several times, forming some kind of pattern. In fact it was alphabetical letters.<br>&#x201c;H-E-L-P,&#x201d; Picka read.<br>&#x201c;Help?&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt asked. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br>The cat turned and went back the way he had come. The bird, still riding his head, cheeped and flipped one wing, as if encouraging them to follow.<br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;Show us where.&#x201d;<br>They walked through the graveyard, past the F and G gravestones that were shaped like the letters F and G to represent Effie and Gee, who had been hanged in effigy. Past the stone saying FOR PETE&#x2019;S SAKE! in honor of a man who hadn&#x2019;t planned on dying. There were all manner of mildly amusing stones here. Picka and Joy&#x2019;nt had wandered though the graveyard repeatedly, and each time discovered something they had missed before.<br>The cat and bird led them to a collapsed crypt they had not noticed; it was one of several rather old and worn structures scattered through the graveyard. This one had been open and empty, of no concern. The stone slab that formed the roof of the front portal had dropped down, sealing it off.<br>&#x201c;In there?&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt asked.<br>The bird nodded. It was evident that these animals understood human speech, but could not speak it. Many animals were like that.<br>Now they heard a faint &#x201c;Woof!&#x201d; Something was in there!<br>Picka braced himself, got his bone fingers on the stone, and heaved it up and to the side. Walking skeletons had no muscles but were stronger than they looked, being magically animated. The portal was open.<br>A big dark mongrel mundane dog came out, tail wagging, glad to be freed. He joined the other two. The three were evidently friends, odd as such an association might be.<br>&#x201c;You wanted to rescue a dog?&#x201d; Picka asked the cat, surprised again.<br>&#x201c;I think we deserve an explanation,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said.<br>The three animals just looked at her. Maybe they were having trouble with the idea of an explanation, when they couldn&#x2019;t speak human.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s trade,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll tell you about us if you tell us about you.&#x201d;<br>The bird, cat, and dog exchanged glances. Then the bird nodded.<br>&#x201c;First we need a better way to communicate,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. &#x201c;I know just the thing.&#x201d; She fished in her hollow skull and brought out a roll of bone-colored paper. She spread this on the ground. &#x201c;This is a magic marker made from dragon bone,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;I got it from a man I met named Cody, who could decipher any code or language. It works only for living creatures, so I never had use for it before. Whoever wants to talk can put a hand, claw, or paw on it, focus, and it will print your thought. Try it.&#x201d;<br>The cat touched the paper with a paw. Words formed. I AM MIDRANGE CAT.<br>The dog tried it. I AM WOOFER DOG.<br>Finally the bird flew down and landed on it with both feet. II AAMM TTWWEEEETTEERR BBIIRRDD.<br>Midrange made a mewl of impatience. He touched the paper. JUST ONE FOOT, BIRDBRAIN!<br>Tweeter hauled up a foot. OOPS.<br>Woofer touched the marker. HA HA HA!<br>Joy&#x2019;nt glanced at Picka. She had no eyes, of course, but her squared-off eyeholes could be expressive. &#x201c;Now give our history, briefly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am Picka Bone, son of Marrow Bones and Grace&#x2019;l Ossein,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;This is my sister, Joy&#x2019;nt. Our kind, the walking skeletons, originated in the dream realm of the gourd, but Esk Ogre found Marrow on the Lost Path and brought him out to Xanth proper. So Marrow and Grace&#x2019;l are no longer scary dream figures, but regular Xanth denizens. Marrow once accompanied Prince Dolph on an adventure. That was when he met Electra, and later married her, and they got the twin sisters Sorceresses Dawn and Eve. Later Marrow got half a soul, which he shared, so we have eighth souls. So we feel obliged to do some good in Xanth. We have wandered all around, but living humans tend to avoid our company, so we have been unable to do them much good. We agreed to watch this graveyard for a month so the zombies could take a break. This is our last day; we don&#x2019;t know what we&#x2019;ll do tomorrow, but hope it isn&#x2019;t too boring. Our hollow heads get easily bored.&#x201d; He made a little screwing motion with a bone finger, as if boring into his skull.<br>Woofer looked blank. Midrange looked disgusted. Tweeter fell over with melodic laughter.<br>Picka had given them his personal history. Did they really understand any of it? Did they care? How would they respond?<br>The cat touched the marker. A column of print appeared. Digested, it was this:<br>&#x201c;We are three pets brought from Mundania by the Baldwin family fifteen years ago. Our names are Woofer, Tweeter, and Midrange, as specified above. It seems the Baldwins liked music, so they named us after their speakers. We liked our family, but pets don&#x2019;t live forever in drear Mundania, so when we got old we migrated here, thanks to a dispensation from the Demon Xanth, for whom I once did a favor. Now we are back in our primes of life, but even a magic land can get dull, so we are looking for adventure. Woofer has a nose for that sort of thing, and he led us to this cemetery, and to this crypt. There is something interesting in there. But when Woofer went in, the stone fell down, trapping him. So we came to you to beg for help. You helped us, so we owe you a favor. What favor do you want, that we can do?&#x201d;<br>Picka exchanged another eyeless glance with his sister. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d like to find something interesting to do tomorrow,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;So would we,&#x201d; Midrange spelled out on the marker. &#x201c;Maybe we all should share a great adventure.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Agreed,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. &#x201c;What adventure?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We hoped you would know,&#x201d; Midrange printed.<br>Picka tapped his skull with a knuckle. &#x201c;Our empty heads are not great on ideas. In fact I&#x2019;m not great on anything much. Joy&#x2019;nt has the usual skeleton talent of disassembly and reformulation; she can form her bones into different configurations if she gets a good starting kick in the&#x2014;&#x201d; He caught his sister&#x2019;s warning glare. &#x201c;Pelvis. But it doesn&#x2019;t work for me. I&#x2019;m a defective skeleton. A complete nonentity, even among my own kind, which are not exactly live wires. So I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m even worthy of an adventure. But still I wish I could have one.&#x201d;<br>Tweeter flew across and landed on his shoulder bone. &#x201c;Tweet!&#x201d; he tweeted sympathetically.<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Picka said. He was beginning to like the little bird.<br>Woofer woofed.<br>That reminded Picka. &#x201c;What were you looking for in the crypt?&#x201d;<br>Woofer wagged his tail and trotted back to the crypt. The others followed, Joy&#x2019;nt lingering only long enough to recover her marker paper. The crypt was a large one, with room for them all. It had attracted the dog, who had the nose for adventure. There had to be something.<br>But Picka hung back. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t be sure what we&#x2019;ll find in there,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe the way that stone fell, sealing Woofer in, was a warning.&#x201d;<br>That made the others pause. &#x201c;Yet it was open,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. &#x201c;Whatever was inside could have escaped.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Woof!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Woofer says no,&#x201d; Picka said. He was coming to understand these animals even without the marker paper.<br>&#x201c;There should be a plaque on the entry stone,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. She looked around. &#x201c;That must be it, fallen to the side. Maybe an ogre slapped at it in passing.&#x201d;<br>Picka went to look down at the flat stone. &#x201c;Danger: Think Tank,&#x201d; he read.<br>&#x201c;Think what?&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt asked.<br>&#x201c;The stone is weathered,&#x201d; Picka said, &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s what I read. Maybe it&#x2019;s an old storage tank.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then why bury it in a crypt in a graveyard?&#x201d;<br>Picka shrugged with both his clavicles. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s something dangerous in the tank, like a nest of nickelpedes.&#x201d;<br>Even the animals dismissed that. Picka&#x2019;s hollow head sometimes produced empty notions.<br>Woofer tired of the dialogue. He went into the crypt, sniffing for the tank. The others had no choice but to follow, after making sure nothing else could collapse to trap them inside.<br>There in the back was a large machine with caterpillar treads and a gun barrel. Picka recognized it from descriptions of bad machines in the dream realm.<br>&#x201c;I thought those monsters were imaginary,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt murmured, awed. &#x201c;No wonder they buried it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand such things actually exist in Mundania,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;Maybe this one escaped, got into Xanth, and someone put it away so it couldn&#x2019;t tear up our landscape.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, now we know enough about it,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. &#x201c;It is indeed dangerous. We&#x2019;d better bury it again.&#x201d;<br>But Woofer was sniffing the tank. He found something on its back. It looked like an on-off switch.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch that!&#x201d; Picka cried, alarmed.<br>Too late. Woofer was already nosing the switch. It changed position with a brisk click.<br>The tank animated. A muted light came on somewhere inside. There was the sound of a motor running.<br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better get out of here,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said, alarmed.<br>They scrambled out. The tank revved up its gears and followed.<br>&#x201c;Maybe we should turn it off again,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;If we can.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. She ran toward the emerging tank.<br>Its turret turned. Its cannon oriented on her.<br>&#x201c;Watch out!&#x201d; Picka cried.<br>Joy&#x2019;nt threw herself to the ground just as the cannon fired. An oddly shaped ball of light zapped toward her, touching the back of her skull as she dropped.<br>Tweeter flew toward the tank, going for the switch. The cannon oriented on him and fired again. The bulb-shaped ball caught the tip of a wing, and Tweeter spun out of control.<br>By the time they got reorganized, the tank was crashing out of the graveyard and into the surrounding forest. It was too late to stop it.<br>They compared notes. Neither Joy&#x2019;nt nor Tweeter seemed to have been hurt, just disconcerted by the strikes. &#x201c;Those light balls the tank fired,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;They looked like bulbs.&#x201d; Then he realized what it meant. &#x201c;For ideas! It&#x2019;s a <i>think</i> tank. It makes people think of ideas.&#x201d;<br>This time Midrange and Woofer exchanged glances. Midrange went to Joy&#x2019;nt. She brought out the marker and set it down for him.<br>He touched it with a paw. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your idea, Tweeter?&#x201d;<br>Tweeter flew down and put one foot on it. &#x201c;Picka Bone must have a talent.&#x201d;<br>Midrange touched it again. &#x201c;And yours, Joy&#x2019;nt?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That we should visit Princess Eve, who knows all about anything that isn&#x2019;t alive, to ask her what Picka&#x2019;s talent is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They are friends of ours,&#x201d; Picka agreed. &#x201c;We knew them as children; they were three years younger than us. But two years ago Princess Eve married the Dwarf Demon Pluto, and became the Mistress of Hades. She may not be in Xanth now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But her twin sister, Dawn, would know,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt said. &#x201c;We can go to Castle Roogna and ask her where Eve is now.&#x201d;<br>Picka was intrigued. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it. It may not be much of an adventure, but I&#x2019;d really like to know about my talent, if I have one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go too,&#x201d; Midrange printed.<br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt agreed. She was an agreeable person. So was Picka, actually; he was very even-tempered, and could get along with anyone who wasn&#x2019;t spooked by his appearance.<br>&#x201c;Is there anything to eat? We&#x2019;re hungry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We skeletons don&#x2019;t need to eat; we&#x2019;re magical spooks,&#x201d; Picka said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much around the graveyard. Just a few palm trees holding coco-nuts containing hot nut-flavored cocoa, and some mints. Pepper, astonish, fig&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll forage for ourselves,&#x201d; Midrange printed.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Next morning when the zombies returned they set out as a party of five. Picka knew that all of them were glad to be doing something, even if it wasn&#x2019;t much. It gave them the illusion of purpose.<br>The graveyard was off the beaten path&#x2014;in fact, there wasn&#x2019;t even an <i>un</i>beaten path. This did not bother the skeletons or animals, but they were wary, because there were many dangers in backwoods Xanth.<br>Not that the walking skeletons had much to fear. Dragons tended to leave them alone because they weren&#x2019;t very edible; even the marrow in their bones was dry and tasteless. Most living creatures spooked at the very sight of them.<br>The three living animals were protected by an amicability spell put on them by Nimby, the donkey-headed dragon form of the Demon Xanth, so that other creatures meant them no harm. They could still get in trouble on their own, as Woofer had, but that was his own fault.<br>Still, Xanth could come up with surprises, so they were careful. They made their way toward the nearest enchanted path, not hurrying, because hurrying could attract more attention than they cared for. This was a bit circuitous, because none of them knew exactly where the nearest enchanted path was.<br>Woofer, always sniffing things ahead, woofed. He was good at woofing. That meant he had found something halfway interesting. They went in that direction.<br>They came across a standing woman facing away from them. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Picka called. It was better that a stranger hear his voice first, so she wouldn&#x2019;t be as startled by his form.<br>The woman did not answer or move.<br>Joy&#x2019;nt tried. &#x201c;Hello. Can you tell us where the nearest enchanted path is?&#x201d;<br>Still no answer. Then they caught up and saw the woman&#x2019;s front side. She was a metal statue!<br>&#x201c;Woof,&#x201d; Woofer repeated in an I-told-you-so tone.<br>They inspected the statue at close range. It was solid iron, a marvelous image of a bare young human woman. Picka was not into bare human women, but did understand that this one was extremely well formed. He reached out to brush a fallen leaf from her conic left breast.<br>&#x201c;Eeeee!&#x201d; she squealed.<br>Picka fell back, startled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re alive?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m animated, like you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll thank you not to paw me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t paw you,&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;I have no paws.&#x201d;<br>She turned her head with a certain squeakiness. &#x201c;You make no bones about it,&#x201d; she agreed.<br>&#x201c;Who are you, and what are you doing here?&#x201d; Joy&#x2019;nt asked.<br>&#x201c;I am the Iron Maiden, a statue animated by an ancient Magician King.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He animated a statue?&#x201d; Picka asked, amazed. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I never was quite clear on that. He simply said I was statuesque.

The book's original thematic organization gives a welcome order to the flux of contemporary art. Over four hundred of the most significant contemporary artists from around the world are represented, including emerging as well as established figures. The book's lively, straightforward, and authoritative writing makes the volume a perfect introduction to contemporary art for students in the field as well as anyone interested in the subject. This book is the follow-up to Phaidon's extremely successful ART TODAY.</p><p>Eleanor Heartney has been a contributing editor to Art in America and Artpress for over 10 years, reviewing the most significant international art shows, biennials and documentas around the world. Her recent publications include Postmodernism and Critical Condition: American Culture at the Crossroads - Collected Essays of Eleanor Heartney."Coffee tables everywhere are crying out for Phaidon latest tome, Art &amp; Today. It's exactly what you want: a comprehensive overview of art from the Eighties onwards... Arresting images [...] and great prose."-GQ "A welcome overview of today's confused art world... A valuable reference book... Well-illustrated."-Wall Street Journa "The overarching point of Art &amp; Today is to show how the certainties of modernism [...] gave way to the anarchy of post-modern, contemporary art... The book attempts to impose some welcome order and logic on the ensuing chaos (and 400 artists): no easy task when the history is happening around you. Heartney, however, proves up to the challenge: she has an accessible prose style, a profound grasp of art history, and a publishing company willing to include 560 illustrations."-Art World "The history of contemporary art, writes Heartney (Postmodernism), a contributing editor to Art in America, offers a tapestry of stories in an innovative, intellectually vigorous and superbly illustrated survey... Heartney's focus is sharp and selective, and her approach complexly postmodern: the ever-proliferating universe of Matthew Ritchie's installations are discussed in the context of Roland Barthes, Cindy Sherman's photographs as Bakhtinian carnival...

But sometimes you can't find the right word, and what you want to say can't be found in the dictionary. English has its limitations, but the expression you're searching for may exist in another language. <i>In Other Words </i>is a unique collection of well-known and absolutely obscure "untranslatables"&#x2015;linguistic gems that convey a feeling or notion with satisfying precision yet resist simple translation. </p><p>This quirky lexicon of hard-to-translate words gives the reader a new way to look at the world and how words relate to us. The words are arranged by region or country of origin, and a brief introduction to each section&#x2015;each done by a respected translator&#x2015;gives insight into the culture of the people as well as the language. Each of these singular words is cleverly and thoroughly defined, with interesting details and references throughout. The search for that elusive mot juste may be over.</p></p><p><p><b>Christopher J. Moore</b> holds degrees in modern languages and linguistics. He is the author of several books, including a major anthology of Gaelic oral poetry. He lives in France and Spain.</p>Translation is tricky, especially when the language belongs to a people whose culture is very different from one's own. In this short but enthusiastic book, Moore, a linguist, selects from languages across the world words and phrases that are impossible to translate neatly into English. In many cases, the difficulty arises because our culture simply doesn't share the same experiences as others. For instance, the Cantonese word <i>gagung</i> literally means "bare sticks," but represents the growing group of men who will not be able to find a wife because China's one-child policy, and desire for sons, has reduced the proportion of women. Other untranslatable words are those used for a feeling or situation that English only describes in a roundabout way, such as the indigenous word from Tierra del Fuego, <i>mamihlapinatapei</i>, which connotes "an expressive and meaningful silence," romantic or otherwise. Moore ranges through 10 different groups of languages (ancient and classical, indigenous, Nordic and African among them) and breaks a few into individual tongues. He introduces each with a few entertaining anecdotes and literary quotes to provide context, and his style in the definitions is equally witty and accessible. Strangely, the entries are not alphabetized, and some have meanings that are more familiar than he implies, particularly those found in the section on Sanskrit, which is made up entirely of words that have already entered the English vocabulary, such as guru and mantra. Overall, this book will fascinate anyone who loves linguistic oddities or has ever felt "lost in translation." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Like Proust&#39;s masterpiece, A la recherche du temps perdu, the biography is structured as the story of the writer&#39;s slow and at times excruciatingly painful search for a vocation. Proust emerges from Carter&#39;s narrative as an extremely complicated, difficult and brilliant man. Carter goes into some detail to elucidate Proust&#39;s curious sexual identity - from his intense and often histrionic relationships with his male friends to his quasi-pathological attachment to his mother to the bizarre sexual fetishes that emerged in his visits to Parisian brothels. But the biography focuses firmly on Proust&#39;s development as an artist - the distracted years as a dilettantish member of Parisian high-society, the dabbling in journalism and translation and, finally, his emergence as one of the great literary voices of the twentieth century. This is a full, rich, deep, and all encompassing biography of one of the great writers in the world. It is also an elucidating cultural history of the times in which he lived.</p><p>Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Modernity&#34;Magisterial.&#34; Iain Finlayson, The Times (London) &#34;An even-handed down-to-earth biography of one of the most finely tuned novelists of all time.

Wellington Gedge is the man who has everything-but finds himself caught in a series of international events which will, if he doesn&#39;t put a stop to them, leave him wearing the sissy uniform of the American ambassador to Paris.</p><p><b>P. G. Wodehouse</b> (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.One of the tests of a Wodehouse recording is whether the laughs for the listener come from the comic ingenuity of the text, as well as from the comic impersonations of the reader. Though HOT WATER (1932) features none of the familiar series characters from the Wodehouse books, Jonathan Cecil is such an accomplished, versatile Wodehouse reader he can still be consistently funny in performing this collection of goofs. This time the cast includes an American couple with more jewels than brains, a blustery senator, mismatched lovers, a Bloomsbury novelist, a French playboy, and various safecrackers and con men (with designs on the jewels of the rich American wife). The listening experience is an entertaining collaboration of writer and reader.

(Ages 8-12)</p><p>As the boundaries of our world change, so must our atlases. This generously sized 2003 edition of the award-winning <i>National Geographic World Atlas for Young Explorers</i> reflects the latest-possible place-name and boundary changes and features a new 16-page section on the world's oceans (including maps and illustrated essays) and an expanded U.S. section that provides an in-depth look at each region. If you are unfamiliar with the format of previous editions, expert National Geographic cartographers have designed more than 115 pages of colorful, easy-to-read, full-spread political (names and boundaries of countries), physical (land forms and water features), and thematic (displaying patterns such as climate) maps for children ages 8 to 12. All maps are shown in the context of surrounding areas. The plentiful color photographs, illustrations, and charts make this an interesting book to casually peruse, as do engaging captions about everything from golden toads to Pueblo Indian artists. The maps themselves are labeled with large, legible type. Students will also find a glossary of geographic terms, a chart of key world facts and figures, conversion tables, and a detailed index. A fine atlas for school projects or for browsing through on a rainy day. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Grade 4-8-This new edition of an essential resource incorporates the latest global changes in place-names, boundaries, and statistics. Though the general appearance, at first glance, seems nearly identical to the 1998 edition, a careful look reveals that many explanations have been rewritten in clearer language or lengthened. Likewise, the majority of striking color photos remains intact, though new images and captions have been added. In the first section, "The World," new spreads on "People" and "World Economies" have replaced "Population Density" and "Transportation and Communication." Continent fact boxes reflect population shifts and changes in life expectancy. (Somewhat puzzling is the fact that the area of the U.S. seems to have increased by nearly 100,000 square miles in the past five years.) There are several new or updated country flags. The most striking addition, however, is the 14-page section on the world's oceans, which begins with marine life, followed by a fascinating discussion of the challenges of mapping the ocean floor. Another spread likens the ocean to "the Earth's radiator," explaining how it warms and controls climate.

How he stands on the issues or how he stands up to the camera? The Selling of the President is the enduring story of the 1968 campaign that wrote the script for modern Presidential politicking-and how that script came to be. It introduces: Harry Treleaven, the first adman to suggest that issues bore voters, that image is what counts. Roger Ailes, a PR man who coordinated the TV presentations that delivered the product. Frank Shakespeare, the man behind the whole campaign, who, after eighteen years at CBS, cast the image that sold America a President.

In this new work, <i>The Last Novel,</i> an elderly author (referred to only as Novelist&#x201d;) announces that since this will be his final effort, he has carte blanche to do anything he damned well pleases.&#x201d;<br><br>Pressed by solitude and age, Novelist's preoccupations inevitably turn to the stories of other artists their genius, their lack of recognition, and their deaths. Keeping his personal history out of the story as much as possible, Novelist creates an incantatory stream of fascinating triumphs and failures from the lives of famous and not-so-famous painters, writers, musicians, sports figures, and scientists.<br><br>As Novelist moves through his last years, a minimalist self-portrait emerges, becoming an intricate masterpiece from David Markson's astonishing imagination. Through these startling, sometimes comic, but often tragic anecdotes we unexpectedly discern the entire shape of a man's life.</p><p>The latest engaging, indefinable work from Markson (Vanishing Point) proves to be something between a writer's commonplace book and La Rochefoucauld's satirically aphoristic Maxims. A set of absorbing factoids and musings&#x2014;from and about a variety of literary and historical notables&#x2014;comprise his narrator's last novel. With a delight in experimentation, Markson manages to insinuate a sober narrative voice between and among the words of the greats. After a quote from Eugene V. Debs (Nobody can be nobody) comes a telling moment of clarification about his own text's aim: Novelist's personal genre. For all its seeming fragmentation, nonetheless obstinately cross-referenced and of cryptic interconnectivity syntax. Indeed, the quotations, separated by a poetic amount of white space, read smoothly one after the other. Most are only a few lines long, and they range from bons mots by famous writers (Rousseau: The man who eats in idleness what he has not earned is a thief) to the writerly non sequitur (Napoleon was five feet six inches tall). Old age, defeat and death emerge as leitmotifs, underscored by statements of the places and dates of various authors' deaths, and, slowly, of the narrator's own poverty and loneliness. Markson's dark fragments are, paradoxically, a joy to sift and ponder. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."Is there one major Dostoevsky novel in which no one commits suicide?" "Lenin played tennis." These trivia bits and much more fill the pages of Markson's latest experimental work, a hybrid novel and fun-fact compendium that will have many rushing for their <i>Bartlett's</i> and others clutching their skulls in despair. There is an aged protagonist named Novelist who periodically pops up among the anecdotes and quotations, often to comment wearily on his depression, and Markson uses this sort-of character to create a sort of tension--who is Novelist, and why is he or she obsessed with gossip, coincidences, facetiae, and death? Literary sleuths might find satisfaction in Markson's sporadic clues, but some will find that the book too closely resembles a cleverly sequenced quote-a-day desk calendar. Most intriguing (and problematic) is Markson/Novelist's tendency to anticipate reader complaints, a tactic that could engage fans of meta-lit but aggravate those tired of blog-style self-consciousness. There's a lulling beauty here--and a crackling wit, too--but readers will have to ask themselves: Does the end of this "seminonfictional semifiction" justify the means? <i>Daniel Krause</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He was staring at her from an antique mirror in the ballroom, standing among gaudily dressed women in an old-time western saloon. Keighly could only discover that his name was Darby Elder -- and that he lived a century ago. Twenty years later, engaged to be married, Keighly inherited her grandmother&#39;s house. Back before the ballroom mirror, she faces a handsome cowboy whose roguish air radiates trouble. Keighly senses the spirit of Darby Elder -- along with an electric charge of passion passing through the glass...and into her heart.

Her emotions were mixed: she had always loved this place, and her experiences here had almost invariably been happy ones. Still, its very emptiness was a painful reminder that her grandmother and parents were dead. </p><p> Keighly sighed. She owned a small art gallery in Los Angeles, selling other people's paintings and sculptures, and she and Julian had been dating seriously for five years. She had plenty of money, inherited from her parents and carefully invested. There was no reason to hold on to an enormous old house in the near-ghost town of Redemption, Nevada, fifty miles from anywhere, and yet Keighly had not wanted to give the place up. </p><p> The reality was that the mansion was literally falling to ruin; it was time to do something -- restore it and put it on the market, turn it into a shelter of some sort, donate it to the local historical society, if there was one... </p><p> Or move in herself, and pursue her sculpting in peace. </p><p> Keighly shook her head. That last idea was out of the question, of course. She had the gallery to consider, a circle of friends...and Julian. A successful pediatric surgeon, he could not be expected to abandon a thriving practice and start all over in a town so small that even freight trains didn't pass through. </p><p> She felt a mild surge of irritation, and suppressed it quickly. She was thirty years old, after all, and she wanted children. But, that required a husband, which was where Julian came in. </p><p> Keighly picked up her suitcase and sighed again. It wasn't that she didn't love him -- he was sweet, steady, and even good-looking, if a little on the predictable side. It was just that -- well -- where was all the wild passion she'd expected to feel? Where was the poetry, the romance? </p><p> Where was Darby? </p><p> At the foot of the broad stairway leading to the second floor, Keighly glanced toward the tall double doors of the ballroom, which stood slightly ajar, remembering the photographs of her grandparents dancing there, Gram in her wedding dress, Grandfather in his coat and tails. </p><p> Oddly, a stray breeze stirred the strings of Aunt Marthe's harp just then, and Keighly thought she heard the notes shape themselves into a brief, merry tune. </p><p> Brow puckered in a slight frown, she put the suitcase down again and, after drawing a deep breath and squaring her shoulders, proceeded into the ballroom. She glanced at the harp, a large instrument, once spectacular, like the house, but now fallen into disrepair. </p><p> Keighly knew she was stalling. On some level, she'd been thinking about this room and its mirrored wall since the last time she'd visited the house, several years before, when she'd been tempted to sell. In the end, she hadn't had the heart, even though the real-estate market had been booming then and her uncles and cousins had all encouraged her to go for the big bucks. </p><p> She hadn't seen Darby during that visit, which shouldn't have surprised her, she supposed. There had been no sign of him the day the memorial service was held for her father, or after her grandmother's funeral, either. His absence had seemed like a betrayal, and deepened her already fathomless grief. </p><p> She forced herself across the dusty marble floor and stood directly in front of the mirror, in just the spot where she'd first glimpsed Darby, on her seventh birthday. </p><p> Nothing. </p><p> Unexpected tears burned in Keighly's eyes. "Where are you?" she asked in a whisper. </p><p> The harp's strings stirred, and overhead, the crystal teardrops of the Murano chandelier tinkled a soft, almost mystical response. A sweet shiver danced up Keighly's spine. </p><p> She was alone, of course. </p><p> She smiled ruefully and turned back to the mirror, almost as an afterthought, and what she saw made her gasp. </p><p> There was still no sign of Darby, but the saloon was back, crammed with unsavory-looking types in canvas dusters, battered cowboy hats, and mud-caked boots. Stringy hair and pockmarked faces abounded. On a small stage at one end of the room, three women in scanty costumes and garish makeup performed a suggestive dance, while a diminutive man wearing a derby, garters on his shirtsleeves, and high-water pants with suspenders hammered away at the keys of the same ruin of a piano. A fat, mustachioed barkeeper polished glasses, and other men played cards at various tables, most of them armed with long-barreled pistols in battered holsters. </p><p> The tableau was completely silent, and yet Keighly felt the faintest vibrations of sound and energy, as though the scene were just barely beyond the reach of her hearing. The colors were vivid; women moved among the tables serving beer and whiskey, as sleekly bright and colorfully plumed as birds from some undiscovered jungle. </p><p> Suddenly, desperately, Keighly wanted to step through the mirror, like Alice, and enter that other world. </p><p> She retreated a step, swallowing hard. Her own image, that of a tall, slender blond woman clad in bluejeans, a white cotton shirt, and a lightweight tweed blazer, was hazy and transparent. As though <i>she</i> were the ghost, and not the long-dead people on the other side of the glass. </p><p> The uncomfortable sense of unreality she so often felt intensified in those moments, making her light-headed. </p><p> Holding her breath, Keighly stared through her reflection at the scene beyond. </p><p> She took another step back. Instinctively, she knew that the cowboys and the dancing girls and the barkeeper were not specters or hallucinations; they were utterly real, going about their business in their own niche in time, completely unaware of her presence. </p><p> Only Darby, she thought with a pang, had ever been able to see her. </p><p> Where had he gone? </p><p> Keighly dashed at her cheeks with the back of one hand. Maybe he'd died, she thought. What she was seeing was obviously the nineteenth century, and mortality rates had been high there, for everybody. The population was plagued by such killers as typhoid, smallpox, cholera, and consumption, to name only a few. People carried guns, and didn't hesitate to use them. </p><p> Of course, they did that in L.A </p><p> She shook her head involuntarily, rejecting the idea that Darby could be dead. In almost the same moment, she made up her mind to have a look at the old part of the local cemetery, a place she had assiduously avoided when visiting her dad's and grandmother's graves. Unless Darby had left Redemption, never to return -- a distinct possibility -- there might be a stone or monnument bearing his name and the date of his death. </p><p> The spectacle in the mirror began to fade, and Keighly leaped forward again, without thought, pressing both hands to the glass as though to hold on, to stop all those busy strangers from leaving her. A moment later, she moved back again, quickly, and dusted her palms on the thighs of her jeans. </p><p> Keighly turned and left the ballroom with as much dignity as she could muster. </p><p> Once, she'd visited a psychiatrist in L.A. and told him about the mirror, and he'd diagnosed the phenomenon as an "autogenic hallucination," a condition often associated with migraines. Keighly had explained that she never had a headache serious enough to be described as migraine in her life, only to be handed a prescription fo pain pills. </p><p> She'd tossed the slip of paper into a trash bin in the lobby of the doctor's office building. </p><p> Even now, she didn't question her sanity. Yes, she was a sculptor and therefore an artist -- Julian said she was hopelessly right-brained -- and she had always had a active imagination. But Darby and the Blue Garter Saloon were not illusions. </p><p> Were they? </p><p> She was in her old room, studying the naked mattress on the narrow canopy bed with distaste, when the cellular telephone in her purse gave a burbling ring. </p><p> Knowing the caller was Julian, Keighly hesitated, then pulled the electronic marvel out of her bag and flipped down the mouthpiece. </p><p> "Hello, Julian," she said. Had she sounded snappish? She hoped not, because Julian didn't deserve that kind of treatment. He was only being thoughtful. He was <i>always</i> being thoughtful, no matter what he said or did. He chuckled, and she imagined him in the hallway of Los Angeles' Mercy Hospital, wearing his lab coat and stethoscope over a crisp white shirt and well-pressed trousers. His dark hair would be impeccably combed, no matter how frantic the day had been. Nothing, but nothing, ruffled Dr. Julian Drury, miracle-worker and surgeon extraordinaire. </p><p> "I guess I should be grateful you weren't expecting a call from some other man," he said. </p><p> Keighly held back a sigh, shoved the fingers of her free hand through her hair. "I'm a one-man woman," she replied, a little flippantly. <i>If you don't count your weird obsession with Darby Elder,</i> taunted some part of her brain that usually minded its own business and kept quiet. </p><p> "How was the trip, darling?" </p><p> "Long," Keighly answered. "I'll feel better once I've had a shower and something to eat." She glanced at her watch -- it was nearly four in the afternoon -- then at the bed, where her suitcase rested, unopened. Maybe she would check into a motel, just for a few days, until the utilities were turned on and she'd had a chance to buy a cot and some blankets, sheets and pillows. She'd been so anxious to return that she hadn't foreseen the need for secondary lodgings. </p><p> Julian would have, of course. He'd have planned ahead. Made reservations. </p><p> No, Keighly thought ruefully. The whole trip was a fool's errand to him; he wouldn't have come back at all, if he were in her place. </p><p> "Do you know what I think you should do?" he asked, startling her back to attention. </p><p> <i>Yes,</i> Keighly reflected, mentally rolling her eyes. Julian meant well, but he could be so pedantic. <i>You've already told me a thousand times, and now you're going to tell me again. And I'll listen because I want so badly to love you.</i> "What?" she asked, in a quavering voice. </p><p> "Get a good night's sleep, hire a real-estate agent to sell that monstrosity of a house, and then drive straight back to L.A. Your life is here, Keighly. With me." </p><p> She was starting to get the kind of headache that called for a buffered pain reliever, and it annoyed her that Julian had referred to her grandmother's home as a "monstrosity," when he'd never even seen it, but she was too tired to debate the matter. "It isn't going to be that simple, Julian," she replied moderately. "The place needs a lot of fixing up and besides, Redemption isn't exactly the crossroads of the nation. People aren't clamoring to buy property here." </p><p> "So hire carpenters and painters and leave already," Julian said, with a sort of blithe peevishness. "Give the place to the town for a library or free clinic, blow it up or burn it down. Just get rid of it." </p><p> Keighly waited a beat before answering. She hated it when they quarreled, and being so far apart would make it worse. "What do you care if I own one old house in the desert?" she asked, as reasonably as she could. "You have investment property all over the country, after all." </p><p> "That's just the point," Julian replied, with tender indulgence. "I have <i>investments.</i> Holding on to a rickety old mausoleum in a ghost town is not good resource management, Keighly." </p><p> Keighly bit her lower lip. "I think we should talk about this another time." </p><p> "When, if not now?" </p><p> "Julian, I have a headache. I'm tired and I'm cranky and I'm feeling very unreasonable. That's why I am hanging up now. Pressing the End button. Good-bye, Julian. I'll call you in a few days." </p><p> His sigh bounced up to some satellite and back down, into Keighly's ear. She visualized the whole process, and it seemed to take place in slow motion. "I'm sorry, darling. You're right -- this is no time to talk about anything important. And I'm being paged, so I'd better go. Get some rest, Keighly." </p><p> With that, he was gone. </p><p> Irritated with herself, rather than Julian, Keighly switched off the power on the cell phone and tossed it back into her purse. Then, picking up her suitcase again, she left her childhood bedroom and went downstairs to her car. She passed the Shady Lane Motel on the way to the cemetery, and smiled to herself. No concierge floor there, she thought. No room service, and no minibar. But at least the place would be clean, and the VACANCY sign was lit. </p><p> Reaching the Redemption Cemetery, Keighly stopped to pay her respects to her father and grandmother before moving on to the weed-filled part of the grounds, where the oldest graves were. Here, there were crooked monuments, weathered crosses, and, occasionally, brass nameplates all but covered in dirt and grass. </p><p> Some sites were ringed with white stones or broken bricks, and many had vanished altogether. More than an hour had passed before Keighly found Darby Elder's grave, tucked away in a plot belonging to a family named Kavanagh, and marked with a bronze sundial, half grown over with moss. </p><p> It did not surprise her, this tangible proof that a person called Darby Elder had actually lived. </p><p> It was the family plot that troubled her. </p><p> Maybe, Keighly reasoned, with a strange, deep pang of sorrow, Darby had married a woman of that name. Or perhaps the Kavanaghs had been his mother's people. In either case, she had never heard her grandmother mention that particular clan, and that was odd, since Gram had been an authority on Redemption's colorful history. </p><p> She caressed the name with almost reverent fingertips. It was spelled out in large, raised letters, simple and unembellished. Finally, with a sigh, she scraped away the debris in order to read the dates beneath. </p><p> <i>Born, 1857. Died, 1887.</i> </p><p> Keighly's throat closed over a soft sob, and again tears stung her eyes. It was just plain silly to be kneeling in an overgrown graveyard, mourning a man who'd died over a century before, but there she was. </p><p> What would Julian say, if he saw her now? </p><p> She smiled a little, despite the sorrow that gripped her, rising awkwardly to her feet, dusting her dirty hands off on her jeans. He'd probably suggest, with a teasing glint in his eyes, that she look into the possibility of having a left-brain transplant, since her own didn't seem to be functioning. </p><p> She drove away from the cemetery in a hurry, and stopped at a filling station to wash her hands and face and run a comb through her hair before checking into the Shady Lane Motel. After a consuming a grilled-cheese sandwich from the snack bar in the bowling alley across the street, she went back to her room, bolted the door, took off her clothes, and headed for the shower. </p><p> Afterward, she pulled on a cotton nightshirt, brushed her teeth, and fell into bed, attempting to watch television. There was noth...</p></p><h2>Everest: Summit of Achievement</h2><p>Everest: Summit Of Achievement On 29 May 1953, New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay stood atop the highest mountain in the world, where no one had ever stood before. This magnificent volume celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of their historic climb and chronicles the history of Everest exploration from the early years of the twentieth century to the present. It is the first and only book on the subject to benefit from complete access to the Royal Geographical Society&#39;s astonishingly rich collection of photographs, documents, and artifacts. Painstakingly selected from over 20,000 subjects, more than 400 photographs -- many never before published -- record the surveying, planning, reconnaissance expeditions, and ascents that the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club jointly launched -- beginning in 1921 and culminating in Hillary and Norgay&#39;s landmark feat. Among the memorable photographs reproduced here are the first aerial views of Mount Everest; the last known photograph of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, who perished soon afterward on the slopes of Everest; Hillary&#39;s iconic photograph of Tenzing Norgay standing triumphant on Everest&#39;s summit; images showing the daily experience of expedition members along with the dangers they faced; portraits of the life and customs of Sherpas and the other Tibetan peoples; and the spectacular beauty of the Everest massif itself. These unique and breathtaking images are prefaced by Sir Edmund Hillary and HisHoliness the Dalai Lama, and are accompanied by chapters written by renowned mountaineer Stephen Venables; the well-known journalist and mountain climber Ed Douglas; Judy and Tashi Tenzing, grandson of Norgay; and noted historian John Keay. The result is a work of lasting significance that captures as never before the sense of discovery, excitement, achievement, and exhilaration experienced over the years by those who are brave and determined enough to challenge the world&#39;s greatest mountain.</p><p>George Mallory's famous answer to why he was so dedicated to scaling Mt. Everest-"Because it's there"-is as good an answer as any to those wondering why so many people risk life and limb to ascend the world's highest peak. This lavish volume, featuring hundreds of photos and documents from the massive archives at London's Royal Geographical Society, offers a less prosaic reason for all that risk taking. The photos are, almost without exception, utterly breathtaking, finding an almost infinite variety of ways to capture Everest's soaring, snow-covered vastness (often with a string of antlike human climbers scurrying somewhere in the foreground). However, the text between the glorious photos is uneven. Some of the pieces are enlightening, especially those detailing the reactions of Nepalese and Tibetan locals to the people who came tromping into their lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries simply to scale the mountains (a beyond-foolish endeavor, they thought). The most engaging of these is Ed Douglas's, on how the mountains fit in with the locals' religious lives (the accompanying photos of grim-faced nuns and monks are striking). Descriptions of mountaineering trips, especially that by climber Venables, are competently delivered but less engrossing. The photographs-depicting Mallory's pal Sandy Irvine cheerfully fixing an oxygen cylinder in 1924; Hillary and climbing companion Tenzing Norgay drinking a celebratory cup of tea in 1953; and (more harshly) porters, who earned little more than a dollar a day, staggering with climbers' baggage in 1971-are undoubtedly this volume's strength.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.*Starred Review* Mount Everest has never been the subject of a book quite this phenomenal. It commemorates the nine expeditions to the Everest massif by Britain's Royal Geographic Society, the ninth culminating in Tenzing Norgay's iconic pose on the peak 50 years ago. From the immense archive documenting these efforts, this album culls several hundred images, many of invaluable ethnographic value, as the Tibetan culture photographed in the 1920s and 1930s was virtually wiped out by the Chinese communists in the 1950s. The mountain itself is staggeringly spectacular. Expedition photographers have been careful to portray from a distance the intimidating wall of the Himalayan Mountains, with Everest's pyramidal summit towering above its guardians. Closer in, the camera often captured a climber gazing upon the mountain-wreathing clouds--romantically contemplating the ethereal scene, perhaps? Perhaps not: the text faithfully records the arduousness and danger of the entire enterprise. The text is indeed well done, featuring an introduction by Edmund Hillary, historian John Keay's preface about the survey that identified the world's tallest mountain, a narrative proper by mountaineer Stephen Venables, and chapters on the Sherpas and their lore. The complete package on the mountain's early history, this work is absolutely enthralling. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is even more impressive in light of the circumstances in which it was created: Faced with terminal cancer, virtual bankruptcy, and a family he would leave without means of support, he took the advice of his publisher, mark Twain, and went to work. He completed the manuscript in eleven months-and died a week later, on July 23, 1885. Frank and unpretentious, Grant's memoirs tell the story of his boyhood in Ohio, his graduation from West Point, and the military campaigns in the West and Mexico that ended with his disgraceful resignation and a return to Illinois, where he ran the family store. Soon, however, began the rebellion that broke the Union and recast Grant's fortune, transforming him into the leader of the victorious Union armies in the War Between the States and giving him the perspective to describe intimately the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Vicksburg, the bloody Wilderness campaign, and Appomattox. Here is Grant the tactician, the alcoholic, the plain and tough professional soldier, the ideal commander-but most of all here is Grant the writer as he assesses himself and the events that forged his character, as well as that of the nation.</p><p>William S.

P. (before pizza)? When Mrs. Pelligrino visits relatives in a quiet Queens (New York) neighborhood c. 1950, local knowledge of Italian language and cuisine is limited to spaghetti, macaroni, and lasagna. Their glum visitor speaks little English, so the children try without much success both to cheer her up and to understand her reiterated complaint: "No pizza!" Finally the girls do a bit of research, and then buy the necessary ingredients. Mrs. Pelligrino is ecstatic and unwraps the rolling pin that she has been cradling. The children are skeptical--their reaction to the recipe had been "Yuk"--but the finished product thrills everyone. Khalsa's paintings are also satisfying: a wide range of flat, bright colors in her naive style conveys the cheerful simplicity of a lost Eden. The jacket illustration, a smiling Mrs. P. and her four young friends whirling dough aloft, and the pizza-in-the-sky endpapers are particularly successful. Culinary historians may question this version of pizza's advent (and the text might have been shorter), but, like its subject, this product should appeal to popular tastes. --Patricia Dooley, University of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.May, of My Family Vacation , is staying with her good friends Linda, Judy and Peggy Penny while her parents are away. The Penny family is visited by a distant cousin, elderly Mrs. Pelligrini, who walks through the kitchen door, sniffs the air and immediately declares, "Is no good." The girls notice that the only time the elderly visitor is really happy is when she is cooking, and they all wonder about the mysterious "pizza" that Mrs. Pelligrini misses so much. "Maybe it's her daughter . . . " says one of the girls. "Or her dog," ventures another. When the girls learn, at the library, the meaning of the word pizza, they copy the list of ingredients and then go shopping. Mrs. Pelligrini, seeing the items the girls have assembled, flies into action, and soon the house is filled with the aroma of the bubbling, baking pie. This amusing story is embellished with Khalsa's intensely colored paintings in her vigorous primitive style, each one brimming with details of family life a few decades ago.

The whole collection is strong, passionate, and poignant, but the mother and daughter poems, fierce and emotional, with their intense ambivalence, pain and joy, themes of separation and reconnecting, are among the very strongest about that difficult relationship.<br><br>"These striking, original, beautifully sensuous poems do just that. Ordinary moments--a sunset, a walk, a private religious ritual--are so alive in poems like 'Shabbat moment'&nbsp;&nbsp;and 'Rosh Hodesh.' In the same way that she celebrates ordinary moments, small things become charged with memories and feelings: paper snowflakes, buttons, one bird, a bottle-cap flower made from a ginger ale top and crystal beads. <br><br>"She celebrates the body in rollicking, gusto-filled poems like 'Belly good' and 'The chuppah,' where 'our bodies open their portals wide.' So much that is richly sensuous: 'hands that caressed you,&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . untied the knot of pleasure and loosened your flesh till it fluttered,' and lush praise for 'life in our spines, our throats,&nbsp;&nbsp;our knees, our genitals, our brains, our tongues.'<br><br>"I love the humor in poems like 'Eat fruit,' the nostalgia and joy in 'The rabbi's granddaughter and the Christmas tree,' the fresh, beautiful images of nature--'In winter . . .the sun hangs its wizened rosehip in the oaks.'<br><br>"I admire Piercy's sense of the past alive in the present, in personal and social history. The poems are memorials, like the yahrtzeit candle in a glass. 'We lose and we go on losing,' but the poems are never far from harsh joy, the joy that is 'the wine of life.'<br><br>"Growing up haunted by Holocaust ghosts is an echo throughout the book, and some of the strongest poems are about the Holocaust, poems that become the voices of those who had no voice: 'What you&nbsp;&nbsp;carry in your blood is us,&nbsp;&nbsp;the books we did not write, music we could not make, a world&nbsp;&nbsp;gone from gristle to smoke, only&nbsp;&nbsp;as real now as words can make it.'<br><br>"Marge Piercy's words make such a moving variety of experiences beautifully and forcefully real."</p><p><i>The Art of Blessing the Day: Poems with a Jewish Theme</i>, by Marge Piercy, is that rare book of self-avowedly religious poetry whose devotional purpose actually enhances its poetic strength. Piercy's poems, organized in chapters with thematic headings like "Family," "Marriage," and "Prayer," are plainly presented as help for living. Readers will turn to poems such as "Putting the Good Things Away" when they need inspiration for understanding their self-sacrificing mothers. Yet Piercy's devotions are real <i>poems</i> with a literary integrity whose strength and beauty are free of sentimentality. They are also like liturgy, because they make room for readers to experience new aspects of contemporary life while simultaneously offering the security of very old frameworks for perceiving life. The Jewish themes of these poems are sometimes overt (as in "Chuppah"), but they are often more subtle (as in "The Art of Blessing the Day"). Throughout, they evince the careful balance of faithful attention to worldly life and the humble consideration of cosmic order that distinguishes Judaism among Western religions. "Attention is love," Piercy writes in the title poem, "what we must give / children, mothers, fathers, pets, / our friends, the news, the woes of others. / What we want to change we curse and then / pick up a tool. Bless whatever you can / with eyes and hands and tongue. If you / can't bless it, get ready to make it new." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"An exquisite book...Strong, passionate and poignant. Marge Piercy's words make a moving variety of experience beautifully and forcefully real."<br>--Lyn Lifshin<p>"Keep her volume near your home altar; Marge Piercy will give wings to your heart's stirrings."<br>--Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi</p><p>"If poetry, as Auden said, exists to praise, then surely it exists to bless. And Marge Piercy teaches us the art of blessing in her poems, with the firmness of her eye, the courage of her strength, the directness of her language, as gritty and sweet and real as the fruits she carries with her on all her journeys through family memory and tradition, prayer and the holy days of sacred year, gathering her wisdom and the wisdom of her difficult Jewish tribe, and bringing that wisdom home."<br>--Rodger Kamenetz, author of <i>Terra Infirma</i>, <i>The Missing Jew : New and Selected Poems</i>,and <i>The Jew in the Lotus</i></p><p>"Whether I find myself guffawing over 'Eat fruit' or falling shattered by "At the well' or being attuned to the Breath of Life by 'Nishmat,' it is my life--my whole life--that I am finding, renewed and enlivened by these poems. We can shmooze these poems, pray these poems, Torah-study these poems. What we breath out, Piercy has breathed in; what Piercy breaths out, we can breath in. We and she breath each other into life."<br>--Rabbi Arthur Waskow</p><p>"Marge Piercy's superb spiritual powers are up to their elbows in the lived world, bringing a liberated and grounded wisdom to everything they touch. Behind this book one hears the great embracing toast of Jewish tradition: 'L'Chaim!' -- 'to life!' In its pages the work of the heart and the work of the spirit are visibly, passionately advanced."<br>--Jane Hirschfield</p><p>"Accessible, transformative, thrilling. Marge Piercy teases out the spiritual lights hidden within the most ordinary events. Here is poetry so reverent and disturbing that it borders on liturgy."<br>--Rabbi Lawrence Kushner</p></p><h2>The Shrinking of Treehorn</h2><p><p>"If you want to pretend you're shrinking, that's all right," said Treehorn's mother, "as long as you don't do it at the table." But Treehorn wasn't pretending. He really was shrinking.</p> <p>Hilarious complications result as he becomes more minuscule by the moment. Treehorn is a bit downhearted when his teacher says, "we don't shrink in this class," and sends him to the principal. Poor Treehorn spends an unhappy day and night until he discovers a magical game that restores him to his natural size. This is a great relief to Treehorn before he notices that he is turning faintly green. . . .</p> <p><strong>An ALA Notable Book</strong></p></p><p>Treehorn is clearly shrinking, and his parents aren't the least bit interested. His mother is obsessed with whether or not her cake will rise. His father, at one point addressing a son who can barely see over the table, states blindly, "Nobody shrinks." Treehorn doesn't seem all that bothered that his clothes are hanging over his extremities; he just feels someone should know. But the adults he tries to notify brush off his claim as either a ploy for attention or downright bad behavior.<p>Treehorn's parents, his teacher, and his principal respond (or fail to respond) to his drastically diminishing stature in ways that will ring true to any kid who has tried to convince adults of the existence of fairies, the Loch Ness Monster, or things that go bump in the night.

Now with The Demon Spirit, Salvatore takes us deeper into the twisted heart of evil that lies at the core of this epic masterwork.<br><br>After believing the tide of darkness has receded from their beloved homeland, Pony and the Ranger Elbryan--soulmates from childhood--together discover the terrifying truth: the power of the demon dactyl was never entirely vanquished by the reverent monk Avelyn Desbris' sacrifice. Now, armed with the mighty magic of the gemstones that are Avelyn's legacy, they must battle a darkness that has infiltrated the most sacred of places--as a once-admired spiritual leader rededicates his life to the most vicious, most insidious revenge against the forces of good. And with the gemstones within grasp, there may be no stopping the spread of the malignant evil . . .<br><br>Epic in scope and spellbinding in its portrayal of the clash between innocence and unspeakable malevolence, R. A. Salvatore's The Demon Spirit is a fantasy tour de force that leaves the reader in breathless anticipation of this extraordinary trilogy's stunning conclusion.</p><p>The Demon trilogy by R.A. Salvatore began with <i>The Demon Awakens</i> and continues with <i>The Demon Spirit</i>. Corona is a fantasy world regularly menaced by the "demon dactyl" who organizes the usual suspects--goblins, dwarfs, giants--in hope of wiping out humanity. Having been comprehensively blown up in book one, the now bodiless demon resorts to corrupting the soul of the abbot who is Corona's chief religious leader. It's an easy task, since despite a few good monks the church is already a murderous, hypocritical outfit. <p> On the other side, Elbryan the elf-trained warrior and his magic-wielding lady are busy cleaning up the increasingly disorganized remnants of the demon's armies, with skilled assistance from elf and thief companions. The magic comes from stones and jewels with various interesting powers, liberated from the church by a renegade monk in book one. This annoys the Abbot no end, and his "Brother Justice" assassins are hot on the stones' trail, bumping off rival clerics and innocent bystanders en route. </p><p> There's plenty of slick incidental adventure and skirmishing, and even an exciting raid on the torture chambers of the biggest and best-defended abbey. Meanwhile the battle lines are being rearranged: the fight is no longer against the demon but the now demon-influenced church, with the final clash scheduled for the concluding volume <i>The Demon Apostle</i>. Fast-moving commercial fantasy that delivers action rather than misty enchantment. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk </i></p>Salvatore rocks. Here's a writer famous for solid action-adventure fantasy, who keeps writing better and better books. Each one has all the action and adventure you could ask for, but with the writing and the stories getting richer, deeper, meatier with each book. And people notice! Even Publishers Weekly gave DEMON SPIRIT a rave--which has to be like having the Wall Street Journal write your company up as the next big thing, or having a big national guide rate the restaurant down on the corner as one of the country's best. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>--Veronica Chapman, Senior Editor</p></p><h2>Nature Spirits: Selected Lectures</h2><p>Based on knowledge attained through his highly trained clairvoyance, Steiner contends that folk traditions regarding nature spirits are based on spiritual reality. He describes how people possessed a natural spiritual vision in ancient times, enabling them to commune with nature spirits. These entities&#x2015;also referred to as elemental beings&#x2015;became immortalized as fairies and gnomes in myth, legend, and children&#x2019;s stories. <br><br> Today, says Steiner, the instinctive understanding that humanity once had for these elemental beings should be transformed into clear scientific knowledge. He even asserts that humanity will not be able to reconnect with the spiritual world if it cannot develop a new relationship to the elementals. The nature spirits themselves want to be of great assistance to us, acting as &#x201c;emissaries of higher divine spiritual beings.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Christianity &amp; Western Thought, Volume 2: Faith &amp; Reason in the 19th Century</h2><p>The nineteenth century continues to wield its substantial influence. Marx, Mill, Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Emerson, Darwin, Freud and Weber brought their era new realms of thought which still populate our imaginations. As a result, the study of history, science, psychology, philosophy, sociology and religion has not been the same. These heirs to rationalism began to explore the full range of human experience--which became a matter of philosophical and theological interest, and even authority. Romanticism flourished in arts and literature as Idealism, Transcendentalism, Pragmatism and other movements developed. All had a profound effect on religion and how it was viewed--particularly on Christianity. Colin Brown's <em>Christianity &amp; Western Thought, Volume 1: From the Ancient World to the Age of Enlightenment</em> was widely embraced as a text in philosophy and theology courses around the world. His project is here continued with the same spirit, energy and design by Steve Wilkens and Alan Padgett. Volume 2 dissects and colorfully explains the main intellectual streams of the nineteenth century. Colin Brown wrote of his first volume: "This book is about the changes in preconceptions, world views and paradigms that have affected the ways in which people have thought about religion in general and Christianity in particular in the Western world. . . . It is a historical sketch, written to help students--and anyone else who might be interested--to get a better grasp of the love-hate relationship between philosophy and faith that has gone on for close to two thousand years." Wilkens and Padgett are also at work on a third volume that will survey the developments of twentieth-century philosophy. Once completed, <em>Christianity &amp; Western Thought,</em> in three volumes, will be the premier text of philosophical history written from a conservative Christian perspective.</p><p>Steve Wilkens (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) is professor of philosophy and ethics at Azusa Pacific University. His books include <em>Hidden Worldviews</em>, <em>Faith and Reason: Three Views</em>, <em>Christianity &amp; Western Thought</em> (volumes 2 and 3) and <em>Beyond Bumper Sticker Ethics</em>. He has also taught as an adjunct faculty member at Mount San Antonio College, Glendale Community College, Fuller Theological Seminary and Azusa Pacific University's C. P. Haggard Graduate School of Theology.&#34;The Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century changed the shape and character of the church for all time. The Enlightenment and its nineteenth-century aftermath did the same for the modern world. We cannot understand contemporary culture, values and ways of thinking and their impact on Christianity without an appreciation of what has gone before. Steve Wilkens and Alan Padgett have performed an important service in exploring the interface between the driving ideas of the nineteenth century and Christian thought. They are uniquely qualified for this task. Steve is a trained theologian with an interest in philosophy. Alan is a trained philosopher with an interest in theology. Between them they have produced a jucidious, balanced and well-documented survey of European and North American thought that will serve students and teachers alike. Their work has no rivals in this field.&#34; (Colin Brown, Fuller Theological Seminary)</p><h2>Godzilla Invades America</h2><p>From the author of several bestselling <i>Dinotopia</i> children's novels comes a tale of courage, friendship, and adventure!

To this library, a man brings his 10-year-old son Daniel one cold morning in 1945. Daniel is allowed to choose one book from the shelves and pulls out &#39;La Sombra Del Viento&#39; by Julian Carax. But as he grows up, several people seem inordinately interested in his find. Then, one night, as he is wandering the old streets once more, Daniel is approached by a figure who reminds him of a character from La Sombra del Viento, a character who turns out to be the devil. This man is tracking down every last copy of Carax&#39;s works in order to burn them. What begins as a case of literary curiosity turns into a race to find out the truth behind the life and death of Julian Carax and to save those he left behind. A page-turning exploration of obsession in literature and love, and the places that obsession can lead.</p><p>Carlos Ruiz Zafon was born in Barcelona in 1964. He won the Premio Edebe for his first novel, PRINCE OF THE MISTS and LA SOMBRA DEL VIENTOis a finalist for the Premio Lara. He lives in Los Angeles and works as a scriptwriter.<b>1.</b> <p> A secret's worth depends on the people from whom it must be kept. My first thought on waking was to tell my best friend about the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Tom�s Aguilar was a classmate who devoted his free time and his talent to the invention of wonderfully ingenious contraptions of dubious practicality, like the aerostatic dart or the dynamo spinning top. I pictured us both, equipped with flashlights and compasses, uncovering the mysteries of those bibliographic catacombs. Who better than Tom�s to share my secret? Then, remembering my promise, I decided that circumstances advised me to adopt what in detective novels is termed a different modus operandi. At noon I approached my father to quiz him about the book and about Juli�n Carax-both world famous, I assumed. My plan was to get my hands on his complete works and read them all by the end of the week. To my surprise, I discovered that my father, a natural-born librarian and a walking lexicon of publishers' catalogs and oddities, had never heard of The Shadow of the Wind or Juli�n Carax. Intrigued, he examined the printing history on the back of the title page for clues. </p><p> "It says here that this copy is part of an edition of twenty-five hundred printed in Barcelona by Cabestany Editores, in June 1936." </p><p> "Do you know the publishing house?" </p><p> "It closed down years ago. But, wait, this is not the original. The first edition came out in November 1935 but was printed in Paris....Published by Galiano &amp; Neuval. Doesn't ring a bell." </p><p> "So is this a translation?" </p><p> "It doesn't say so. From what I can see, the text must be the original one." </p><p> "A book in Spanish, first published in France?" </p><p> "It's not that unusual, not in times like these," my father put in. "Perhaps Barcel= can help us...." </p><p> Gustavo Barcel= was an old colleague of my father's who now owned a cavernous establishment on Calle Fernando with a commanding position in the city's secondhand-book trade. Perpetually affixed to his mouth was an unlit pipe that impregnated his person with the aroma of a Persian market. He liked to describe himself as the last romantic, and he was not above claiming that a remote line in his ancestry led directly to Lord Byron himself. As if to prove this connection, Barcel= fashioned his wardrobe in the style of a nineteenth-century dandy. His casual attire consisted of a cravat, white patent leather shoes, and a plain glass monocle that, according to malicious gossip, he did not remove even in the intimacy of the lavatory. Flights of fancy aside, the most significant relative in his lineage was his begetter, an industrialist who had become fabulously wealthy by questionable means at the end of the nineteenth century. According to my father, Gustavo Barcel= was, technically speaking, loaded, and his palatial bookshop was more of a passion than a business. He loved books unreservedly, and-although he denied this categorically-if someone stepped into his bookshop and fell in love with a tome he could not afford, Barcel= would lower its price, or even give it away, if he felt that the buyer was a serious reader and not an accidental browser. Barcel= also boasted an elephantine memory allied to a pedantry that matched his demeanor and the sonority of his voice. If anyone knew about odd books, it was he. That afternoon, after closing the shop, my father suggested that we stroll along to the Els Quatre Gats, a cafT on Calle Montsi=, where Barcel= and his bibliophile knights of the round table gathered to discuss the finer points of decadent poets, dead languages, and neglected, moth-ridden masterpieces. <br> </p><p> Els Quatre Gats was just a five-minute walk from our house and one of my favorite haunts. My parents had met there in 1932, and I attributed my one-way ticket into this world in part to the old cafT's charms. Stone dragons guarded a lamplit fatade anchored in shadows. Inside, voices seemed shaded by the echoes of other times. Accountants, dreamers, and would-be geniuses shared tables with the specters of Pablo Picasso, Isaac AlbTniz, Federico Garcfa Lorca, and Salvador Dalf. There any poor devil could pass for a historical figure for the price of a small coffee. </p><p> "Sempere, old man," proclaimed Barcel= when he saw my father come in. "Hail the prodigal son. To what do we owe the honor?" </p><p> "You owe the honor to my son, Daniel, Don Gustavo. He's just made a discovery." </p><p> "Well, then, pray come and sit down with us, for we must celebrate this ephemeral event," he announced. </p><p> "Ephemeral?" I whispered to my father. </p><p> "Barcel= can express himself only in frilly words," my father whispered back. "Don't say anything, or he'll get carried away." </p><p> The lesser members of the coterie made room for us in their circle, and Barcel=, who enjoyed flaunting his generosity in public, insisted on treating us. </p><p> "How old is the lad?" inquired Barcel=, inspecting me out of the corner of his eye. </p><p> "Almost eleven," I announced. </p><p> Barcel= flashed a sly smile. </p><p> "In other words, ten. Don't add on any years, you rascal. Life will see to that without your help." </p><p> A few of his chums grumbled in assent. Barcel= signaled to a waiter of such remarkable decrepitude that he looked as if he should be declared a national landmark. </p><p> "A cognac for my friend Sempere, from the good bottle, and a cinnamon milk shake for the young one-he's a growing boy. Ah, and bring us some bits of ham, but spare us the delicacies you brought us earlier, eh? If we fancy rubber, we'll call for Pirelli tires." </p><p> The waiter nodded and left, dragging his feet. </p><p> "I hate to bring up the subject," Barcel= said, "but how can there be jobs? In this country nobody ever retires, not even after they're dead. Just look at El Cid. I tell you, we're a hopeless case." </p><p> He sucked on his cold pipe, eyes already scanning the book in my hands. Despite his pretentious fatade and his verbosity, Barcel= could smell good prey the way a wolf scents blood. </p><p> "Let me see," he said, feigning disinterest. "What have we here?" </p><p> I glanced at my father. He nodded approvingly. Without further ado, I handed Barcel= the book. The bookseller greeted it with expert hands. His pianist's fingers quickly explored its texture, consistency, and condition. He located the page with the publication and printer's notices and studied it with Holmesian flair. The rest watched in silence, as if awaiting a miracle, or permission to breathe again. </p><p> "Carax. Interesting," he murmured in an inscrutable tone. </p><p> I held out my hand to recover the book. Barcel= arched his eyebrows but gave it back with an icy smile. </p><p> "Where did you find it, young man?" </p><p> "It's a secret," I answered, knowing that my father would be smiling to himself. Barcel= frowned and looked at my father. "Sempere, my dearest old friend, because it's you and because of the high esteem I hold you in, and in honor of the long and profound friendship that unites us like brothers, let's call it at forty duros, end of story." </p><p> "You'll have to discuss that with my son," my father pointed out. "The book is his." </p><p> Barcel= granted me a wolfish smile. "What do you say, laddie? Forty duros isn't bad for a first sale....Sempere, this boy of yours will make a name for himself in the business." </p><p> The choir cheered his remark. Barcel= gave me a triumphant look and pulled out his leather wallet. He ceremoniously counted out two hundred pesetas, which in those days was quite a fortune, and handed them to me. But I just shook my head. Barcel= scowled. </p><p> "Dear boy, greed is most certainly an ugly, not to say mortal, sin. Be sensible. Call me crazy, but I'll raise that to sixty duros, and you can open a retirement fund. At your age you must start thinking of the future." </p><p> I shook my head again. Barcel= shot a poisonous look at my father through his monocle. </p><p> "Don't look at me," said my father. "I'm only here as an escort." </p><p> Barcel= sighed and peered at me closely. </p><p> "Let's see, junior. <i>What</i> is it you want?" </p><p> "What I want is to know who Juli�n Carax is and where I can find other books he's written." </p><p> Barcel= chuckled and pocketed his wallet, reconsidering his adversary. </p><p> "Goodness, a scholar. Sempere, what do you feed the boy?" </p><p> The bookseller leaned toward me confidentially, and for a second I thought he betrayed a look of respect that had not been there a few moments earlier. </p><p> "We'll make a deal," he said. "Tomorrow, Sunday, in the afternoon, drop by the Ateneo library and ask for me. Bring your precious find with you so that I can examine it properly, and I'll tell you what I know about Juli�n Carax. Quid pro quo." </p><p> "Quid pro what?" </p><p> "Latin, young man. There's no such thing as dead languages, only dormant minds. Paraphrasing, it means that you can't get something for nothing, but since I like you, I'm going to do you a favor." </p><p> The man's oratory could kill flies in midair, but I suspected that if I wanted to find out anything about Juli�n Carax, I'd be well advised to stay on good terms with him. I proffered my most saintly smile in delight at his Latin outpourings. </p><p> "Remember, tomorrow, in the Ateneo," pronounced the bookseller. "But bring the book, or there's no deal." </p><p> "Fine." </p><p> Our conversation slowly merged into the murmuring of the other members of the coffee set. The discussion turned to some documents found in the basement of El Escorial that hinted at the possibility that Don Miguel de Cervantes had in fact been the nom de plume of a large, hairy lady of letters from Toledo. Barcel= seemed distracted, not tempted to claim a share in the debate. He remained quiet, observing me from his fake monocle with a masked smile. Or perhaps he was only looking at the book I held in my hands. </p><p> --from <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> by Carlos Ruiz Safon, Copyright � 2004 Carlos Ruiz Safon, published by The Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., all rights reserved, reprinted with permission from the publisher." <br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Collected Poems of Robert Service</h2><p>Robert Service&#39; still lives as a vagabond in the hearts of his many readers.

WESTLAKE has written numerous novels over the past thirty-five years under his own name and pseudonyms, including Richard Stark. Many of his books have been made into movies, including The Hunter, which became the brilliant film noir Point Blank, and the 1999 smash hit Payback. He penned the Hollywood scripts for The Stepfather and The Grifters, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. The winner of three Edgar awards and a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Donald E. Westlake was presented with The Eye, the Private Eye Writers of America&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award, at the Shamus Awards. He lives with his wife, Abby Adams, in rural New York State.A bored God sends the angel Ananayel to earth to "announce, and to effect, the end of the World" in Westlake's first venture into science fiction. Fed up with humanity, the Supreme Being wants the earth done with once and for all, but helc per chicago doesn't want to do the job himself. Better, God thinks, in his paradoxical, ineffable way, to let humans take care of it themselves, of their own infamous free will. It is Ananayel's task to nudge the necessary actors into place so that they will choose a course that brings about destruction. One by one the angel recruits a lonely young New York woman, a failing victim of the Chernobyl accident, a Chinese student activist, a vengeful former singer from Brazil, a Kenyan prostitute and a good-natured petty thief, and he encourages them none too subtly toward a critical showdown at a nuclear power plant in upstate New York. Satan, meanwhile, has been enjoying the antics of humanity, and sends an emissary of his own to block Ananayel's plot and save the world. Westlake evokes--both humorously and bitterly--the loneliness and hopelessness that color the human condition, posing the age-old question of what makes life worth living despite so much evil. Though he treats this issue only shallowly, Westlake ( Drowned Hopes ; A Likely Story ) lifts his tale with snappy prose and sympathetic characters. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Only Woman in the Room</h2><p><p>The instant <b><em><b><em>New York Times</em></b></em></b> Bestseller<br><br>She possessed a stunning beauty.

In addition to his in-depth accounts of the lives of the three leaders, Wright draws vivid portraits of other fiery personalities who were present at Camp David&#x2013;&#x2013;including Moshe Dayan, Osama el-Baz, and Zbigniew Brzezinski&#x2013;&#x2013;as they work furiously behind the scenes. Wright also explores the significant role played by Rosalynn Carter. <br> What emerges is a riveting view of the making of this unexpected and so far unprecedented peace. Wright exhibits the full extent of Carter&#x2019;s persistence in pushing an agreement forward, the extraordinary way in which the participants at the conference&#x2014;many of them lifelong enemies&#x2014;attained it, and the profound difficulties inherent in the process and its outcome, not the least of which has been the still unsettled struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians.<br><br> In <i>Thirteen Days in September</i>, Wright gives us a resonant work of history and reportage that provides both a timely revisiting of this important diplomatic triumph and an inside look at how peace is made.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Wright is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker </i>and the author of six previous books of nonfiction, including <i>In the New World, Remembering Satan, The Looming Tower, Going Clear, </i>and one novel, <i>God&#x2019;s Favorite.</i> His books have received many prizes and honors, including a Pulitzer Prize for <i>The Looming Tower. </i>He is also a playwright and screenwriter.

He had spent one last glorious day, August 29, 1978, fly-fishing on the Snake River, horseback riding through the park, and picking huckleberries with his daughter, Amy, which went into an after-dinner pie. It was a brief escape from the tumult of Washington and his weakened and unpopular presidency. The briefing book contained psychological profiles of two leaders, Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the prime minister of Israel, who would be coming to America in a few days with the unlikely goal of making peace in the Middle East. The ways in which Carter would relate to these leaders&#x2014;and they to each other&#x2014;would determine the success or failure of this historic gamble.<br><br> .............<br><br> The profiles Carter was studying in Wyoming came from a meeting he had at the CIA a few weeks earlier. He had directed the analysts to answer a number of questions about Begin and Sadat:<br><br> What made them leaders? What was the original root of their ambition?<br> What were their goals? &nbsp;<br> What previous events had shaped their characters? &nbsp;<br> What were their religious beliefs? Were they sincere? &nbsp;<br> Who was important to them? What were their family relations? <br> How was their health? &nbsp;<br> What promises and obligations had they made? &nbsp;<br> How did they react under pressure? &nbsp;<br> What were their strengths and weaknesses? &nbsp;<br> What were their attitudes toward the U.S. and Carter personally? <br> What did they think of each other? &nbsp;<br> Whom did they trust, especially within their delegations?<br><br> The resulting profiles of Begin and Sadat drew sharply opposing por- traits. Sadat was a visionary&#x2014;bold, reckless, and willing to be flexible as long as he believed his overall goals were being achieved. He saw himself as a grand strategic thinker blazing like a comet through the skies of history. The CIA noted his penchant for publicity, terming it his &#x201c;Barbara Walters Syndrome,&#x201d; after the famous television personality, but by the time the profile was prepared for Carter that category had been upgraded to Sadat&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nobel Prize Complex.&#x201d; Begin, on the other hand, was secretive, legalistic, and leery of radical change. History, for Begin, was a box full of tragedy; one shouldn&#x2019;t expect to open it with- out remorse. When put under stress, Sadat drifted into generalities and Begin clung to minutiae. Clashes and misunderstandings were bound to occur. There was some doubt among the analysts preparing the dossiers whether two such opposing personalities should ever be put into the same room together. The two leaders seemed alike only in unpromising ways. Both men had blood on their hands. They had each spent long stretches in prison and in hiding and were deeply schooled in conspiracy. They were not the kind of men Carter had ever known before.<br><br> Carter believed he instinctively understood Sadat, however, even though they came from distant cultures. Part of their bond was the fact that they had both been farmers. As a boy, Carter had plowed the red clay of southwest Georgia behind a mule, feeling the damp cool of the freshly turned earth between his toes. He was struck by the observation that Jesus and Moses would have felt at home on a farm in the Deep South during the first part of the twentieth century. Around the globe but on the same meridian as Plains, Georgia, there is a village of mud huts in Egypt called Mit Abul Kum, where Sadat spent his early years. Farmers in the black alluvial soil of the Nile Delta irrigated their fields using an Archimedes screw, which the Greek sage reputedly invented when he visited Egypt in the third century BCE. One could see painted in the tombs of the pharaohs scenes of village life that were still being lived three thousand years later.<br><br>Changelessness is the essential feature of such rural childhoods&#x2014;a feeling of being cocooned, at once protected and entrapped. And yet, even as a child, a dark-skinned peasant from a small village in the Nile Delta, Sadat sensed his unique role in Egyptian society. Once, when he was playing with some other children near an irrigation canal, they jumped into the water and Anwar leaped in after them. Only then did he remember that he couldn&#x2019;t swim. He thought, &#x201c;If I drown, Egypt will have lost Anwar Sadat!&#x201d;<br><br>Although he rarely talked about his race, Sadat was only two gen- erations away from slavery&#x2014;his maternal grandfather, an African man called Kheirallah, had been brought as a slave to Egypt and was eman- cipated only after the British occupiers demanded the practice be abol- ished. Kheirallah&#x2019;s daughter, Sitt el-Barrein (woman of two banks), was also a black African. She was chosen as a wife for Mohamed el-Sadaty, an interpreter for a British medical group.* She covered herself in traditional black clothing, with long sleeves and a skirt that reached the floor. She was Mohamed&#x2019;s sixth wife; the first five bore him no children, so he divorced them one after another. Sitt el-Barrein would bear him three sons and a daughter. Anwar was her second child.<br><br> The racial dynamics in the Sadaty family were highly charged, as they were in Egyptian society as a whole. Mohamed el-Sadaty&#x2019;s mother, called by custom Umm Mohamed (mother of Mohamed), was an over- bearing figure who had arranged the match with Sitt el-Barrein. It&#x2019;s a bit of a mystery why she made such a choice, since Umm Mohamed was of Turkish lineage, with fair features, and she despised her dark-skinned daughter-in-law. Mohamed inherited his mother&#x2019;s Turkish features; he had blue eyes and blond hair. In Islam, a man is permitted four wives at a time, and Mohamed would eventually marry twice more when the family moved to Cairo. In addition to his three wives and his formidable mother, Mohamed&#x2019;s vast household grew to thirteen children. Sitt el- Barrein occupied the lowliest place because of her race. She was little more than a maid, occasionally beaten by her husband in front of her children. Sadat rarely spoke of her.<br><br>It was his grandmother, Umm Mohamed, the strongest figure in the family, who made the biggest impression on Sadat. &#x201c;How I loved that woman!&#x201d; he recalls in his autobiography. She was illiterate, but she insisted that her children and grandchildren become educated. Anwar often spent summers in Umm Mohamed&#x2019;s mud-walled hut in Mit Abul Kum, where her influence was unequivocal. From an early age he began to imagine himself as a figure of destiny, his imagination fired by the stories his grandmother would tell.<br><br>His favorite was the legend of Zahran. It is a tale of martyrdom. In June 1906, several years before Anwar was born, a party of British soldiers was pigeon hunting in a nearby village called Denshawi. They shot some domesticated fowl, infuriating the villagers. Total chaos followed. One of the soldiers accidentally shot and wounded the wife of the local imam. The villagers responded with a hail of stones. The soldiers fired into the mob, injuring five people. A local silo caught on fire, perhaps because of a stray bullet. Two soldiers raced back to camp to get help, but the other members of the hunting party surrendered to the villagers. One soldier who escaped died of sunstroke in the intense heat, although he may also have suffered a concussion from the stoning. British soldiers who came to the rescue killed an elderly peasant who was trying to assist the dying man, wrongly assuming that he had murdered their comrade. The British occupiers decided to make an example of Denshawi. Fifty- two villagers were rounded up and quickly brought before a tribunal. Most of the villagers were flogged or sentenced to long prison sentences. Four were hanged.<br><br> This confused and tragic incident marked a turning point in the British occupation, inflaming nationalist sentiments in Egypt and stir- ring outrage even in Great Britain. Denshawi became a byword for the inevitable clumsy by-products of imperialism. No one embodied the face of Denshawi more than the young man named Zahran, the first of the condemned to be hanged. According to the oral ballad that Sadat&#x2019;s grandmother told to him, Zahran was the son of a dark mother and a father of mixed blood&#x2014;just like Anwar. &#x201c;The ballad dwells on Zahran&#x2019;s courage and doggedness in the battle, how he walked with his head high to the scaffold, feeling proud that he had stood up to the aggressors and killed one of them,&#x201d; Sadat writes. He heard this legend night after night, and it worked its way deep into his imagination. &#x201c;I often saw Zahran,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;and lived his heroism in dream and reverie&#x2014;I wished <i>I </i>were Zahran.&#x201d;<br><br> It was in Cairo that Anwar first actually encountered the hated occupiers. He recalls &#x201c;the odious sight of the typical British constable on his motorcycle, tearing through the city streets day and night like a madman&#x2014;with a tomato-colored complexion, bulging eyes, and an open mouth&#x2014;looking like an idiot, with his huge head covered in a long crimson fez reaching down to his ears. Everybody feared him. I simply hated the sight of him.&#x201d;<br><br> In 1931, when Anwar was twelve, Mahatma Gandhi passed through the Suez Canal on his way to London to negotiate the fate of India. The ship stopped in Port Said, whereupon Egyptian journalists besieged the ascetic leader. The correspondent for <i>Al-Ahram </i>marveled that Gandhi was wearing &#x201c;nothing but a scrap of cloth worth five piasters, wire rim glasses worth three piasters and the simplest thong sandals worth a mere two piasters. These ten piasters of clothing tell Great Britain volumes.&#x201d; The example of this poor, dark-skinned man who turned the empire upside-down made a deep impression on the young Sadat. &#x201c;I began to imitate him,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;I took off all my clothes, covered myself from the waist down with an apron, made myself a spindle, and withdrew to a solitary nook on the roof of our house in Cairo. I stayed there for a few days until my father persuaded me to give it up. What I was doing would not, he argued, benefit me or Egypt; on the contrary, it would certainly have given me pneumonia.&#x201d; Sadat&#x2019;s obsession with great men must have seemed comical, especially when he imitated Gandhi by sitting under a tree, pretending he didn&#x2019;t want to eat, or dressing in an apron and leading a goat. He was consciously shopping for the qualities of greatness, trying on attributes and opinions. It wasn&#x2019;t just Gandhi&#x2019;s asceticism that appealed to him; he was drawn to the autocratic side of Gandhi&#x2019;s nature, which favored action over deliberation and cared nothing for consensus.<br><br> Despite Sadat&#x2019;s hatred of the British, it was through an English doctor who knew Sadat&#x2019;s father that he was able to enter the Royal Military Academy. Sadat was rescued from the menial destiny he had been born to. The academy had been the exclusive province of the Egyptian aristocracy until 1936, when the British allowed the Egyptian Army to expand. During this period, Sadat read books on the Turkish Revolution and became increasingly devoted to Kemal Atat�rk, the creator of modern Turkey. Sadat was already beginning to see himself as a trans- formational figure whose iron will would rearrange his society into a new paradigm. In that way, he and Begin were much alike.<br><br> Paradoxically, those were the same qualities that drew him to Hitler. &#x201c;I was in our village for the summer vacation when Hitler marched forth from Munich to Berlin, to wipe out the consequences of Germany&#x2019;s defeat in World War I and rebuild his country,&#x201d; Sadat recounts. &#x201c;I gathered my friends and told them we ought to follow Hitler&#x2019;s example by marching forth from Mit Abul Kum to Cairo. I was twelve. They laughed and ran away.&#x201d; Two decades later, after Germany was in ruins and sixty million people were dead, Sadat and other prominent Egyptians were asked by a Cairo magazine to write a letter to Hitler as if he were still alive. &#x201c;My Dear Hitler,&#x201d; Sadat wrote,<br><br> I admire you from the bottom of my heart. Even if you appear to have been defeated, in reality you are the victor. You have succeeded in creating dissension between the old man Churchill and his allies, the sons of Satan. . . . Germany will be reborn in spite of the Western and Eastern powers. . . . You did some mistakes . . . but our faith in your nation has more than compensated for them. You must be proud to have become an immortal leader of Germany. We will not be surprised if you showed up anew in Germany or if a new Hitler should rise to replace you.<br><br> Excerpted from <b>THIRTEEN DAYS IN SEPTEMBER </b>by Lawrence Wright.

This 96-page book provides rich and diverse collections of pattern problems for students to explore, investigate, discover, and create. The five different types of pattern problems found in this book are:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Pattern Predictor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Equality Explorer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Sequence Sleuth<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Number Ninja<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� Function Finder<br><br>There are optional hints and detailed solutions.<br><br>From a developmental perspective, the ability to recognize a pattern signals the transition from concrete to abstract thinking. So having students explore pattern problems helps sensitize them to the discovery process that provides a foundation for authentic learning and abstraction. These activities are independent and self-contained, but tend to build on one another and get gradually more sophisticated. This collection deliberately avoids use of variables, but involves reasoning that lays a genuine foundation for algebraic thinking and technique. Calculators are never needed, and their use is discouraged.<br><br>Parents and teachers should encourage students to pursue these pattern problems with a sense of adventure and perseverance. Although this book's patterns appropriate for Grades 5-7, experiences with these activities may vary widely depending upon readiness for abstraction. There are many ways to solve and explain a pattern problem, and the solutions provided are not intended to be unique. In all situations, and at whatever pace and facility, the transition from concrete to abstract thinking is worthwhile.</p><p></p><h2>On Flirtation</h2><p><p> People tend to flirt only with serious things--madness, disaster, other people's affections. So is flirtation dangerous, exploiting the ambiguity of promises to sabotage our cherished notions of commitment? Or is it, as Adam Phillips suggests, a productive pleasure, keeping things in play, letting us get to know them in different ways, allowing us the fascination of what is unconvincing? This is a book about the possibilities of flirtation, its risks and instructive amusements--about the spaces flirtation opens in the stories we tell ourselves, particularly within the framework of psychoanalysis. </p><p> Phillips looks at life as a tale to be told but rejects the idea of a master plot. Instead, he says, we should be open to the contingent, and flirtation shows us the way. His book observes children flirting with their parents, our various selves flirting with one another, and literature flirting with psychoanalysis. As Phillips explores the links between literature and psychoanalysis--ranging from Philip Roth to Isaac Rosenberg, Karl Kraus to John Clare--psychoanalysis emerges as a multi-authored autobiography. Its subjects are love, loss, and memory; its authors are the analyst and the analysand, as well as the several selves brought to life in the process. A passionate and delightfully playful defense of the virtues of being uncommitted, <i>On Flirtation</i> sets before us the virtue of a yet deeper commitment to the openendedness of our life stories.</p></p><p><b>Adam Phillips</b> is Principal Child Psychotherapist in the Wolverton Gardens Child and Family Consultation Centre, London.Phillips writes as a &#34;flirt&#34;--in the special sense he defines in his opening essay--but how much richer his book is for that. Before next going into print, the envious rivals and embittered former lovers who nowadays cluster around Freud&#39;s name should all report to Phillips for a lesson in flirtation.

Ian Dear tells how only ten of these formidable yachts were ever built and subsequently raced for the America's Cup as well as for other trophies in American and British waters between 1930 and 1937. Yes, there have been bigger and faster yachts. But none has gripped the public's imaginations as much as the J's did. Alas, their enormous cost and the approach of World War banished hope of their production. There are 170 b/w photos and illustrations. --Charleston Daily News, January 2001<br><br>The America's Cup means different things to different people. There are the personalities, the history, the Cup itself, and of course, the boats: everything from the schooner AMERICA to the most brittle IACC design, struggling to stay in one piece off San Diego or on the Huraki Gulf.<br><br>"Among the most beautiful competitors for the Hundred Guinea Cup were the storied J-boats, which raced for sailing's ultimate prize in the 1930's and are the subject of Ian Dear's book ENTERPRISE to ENDEAVOUR, which pays tribute to the great, towering behemoths that to many represent a Golden Age of Cup racing.<br><br>"This past November the book was reissued by the Sheridan House publishing company, in part to mark the latest round of Cup competition now taking place in Auckland, and in part to complement the revival of the J class itself. Although originally published over 20 years ago, the book still captures the spirit of an era that is perhaps the most spectacular in the history of yachting.<br><br>"Coming out at a time when it seemed the class was on the verge of extinction, Dear's book contains a wealth of photographs and information on the development and what then appeared to be the 'short history' of the J's. It opens with a description of the English 'Big Boats' that preceded the era, cutters for the most part like the royal family's BRITANNIA, and goes on to describe how these boats evolved into the Universal Rule-based J-class with boats over 120 feet long.<br><br>"In all only 10 J's were ever constructed, but they brought together the cream of yachting including such luminaries as Sir Thomas Lipton, Harold S. Vanderbilt and Starling Burgess, as well as technical breakthroughs like the first aluminum mast and many radical new winch designs.<br><br>"Although they have been cited many times before, the sheer mass of the Js resulted in some incredible statistics that bear repeating: 170-foot masts, 20-foot overhangs fore and aft, 4-foot-wide Park Avenue booms, 18,000-square-foot spinnakers and 5,000-square-foot mains made of Egyptian cotton that weighed over a ton.<br><br>"Happily, the Sheridan House reprint features a revised Epilogue in which Dear reports on the current status of the class, which couldn't be more in contrast to the situation in the 1970s.<br><br>"'At that time it seemed as if only one, SHAMROCK, would ever sail again and that none could ever be put back into racing and I said this,' he writes of those dark days. 'How wrong one can be, and how glad I am that I was.'<br><br>"Today a number of the giants are back in commission including SHAMROCK, VELSHEDA, ASTRA, CANDIDA and the book's namesake, ENDEAVOUR. Not that it wasn't a close call. Many of the Js, including all the American-built boats like WEETAMOE, RAINBOW, YANKEE and RANGER, were scrapped shortly after their racing careers ended. VELSHEDA lay for years with her keel buried in the mud. ENDEAVOUR was a rusty wreck before finally being brought back to pristine condition.<br><br>"But in the end, there were sailors enough with the drive and financial wherewithal to make sure that more remained of the class than just spectacular photographs. In stark contrast to the time when it first appeared on shelves, Dear's book no longer looks back on a bygone era. Instead, it documents the first chapter in a story that appears ready to endure for years to come. --Sailing, February 2000</p><h2>Painting Landscapes in Oil (Watson-Guptill Painting Library)</h2><p>Beginning with an overview of the genre, this work focuses on the art of composition and the various ways to achieve variety within unity.

I'm stuck in the tree! Help me, or the storm will go on all night."<br><br>Very surprised, Mr. Jones walked down to the tree. in the middle of it was a tall man with a long gray cloak, and a long gray beard, and the brightest eyes you ever saw.<br><br>"Who are you?" Mr. Jones said. "What are you doing in my holly tree?"<br><br>"I got stuck in it, can't you see? Help me out, or the storm will go on all night.

"My wife and I have a baby girl, just born, and we are as happy as any two people in the world."<br><br>"In that case, said the North Wind, I will be the baby's godfather. My birthday present to her will be this necklace of raindrops."<br><br>From under his gray cloak he pulled out a fine silver chain.<br><br>On the chain were three bright, shining drops.<br><br>"You must put it around the baby's neck," he said. "The rain<br><br>drops will not wet her, and they will not come off. Every year,<br><br>on her birthday, I will bring her another drop. When she has four drops she will stay dry, even if she goes out in the hardest rainstorm. And when she has five drops no thunder or lightning can harm her. And when she has six drops she will not be blown<br><br>away, even by the strongest wind. And when she has seven drops she will be able to swim the deepest river.

Elon brilliantly depicts Meyer Amschel Rothschild's position there, and life on the almost unimaginably cramped Judengasse (the single street of the ghetto), where he lived his whole life - even after becoming one of the richest men in Germany. We read how he established his small trading and banking business, and forged an uneasy relationship (though one mutually profitable in different ways) with the financially obsessed Crown Prince Wilhelm of Kassel; how he pushed at and eventually broke through the restrictions that bound him and his family to the ghetto until he found himself essentially paying for the English war effort in the Peninsula in 1810. On a richly delineated canvas the emergence and secularization of a family and Western European Jewry is depicted.<br>Founder is more than a short biography of an obviously extraordinary man. It is a portrait of Meyer Amschel Rothschild's times, of the condition of the Jews, of the state of Germany until it was overrun by the troops of Napoleonic France, which led to the collapse of the old order. It is about the threshold of modern times, when a world of aristocrats and gentlemen was permanently changed by a shrewd, dedicated, and loyal financier and his family. We still cannot know him as well as we do his children; but at last, in this book, Meyer Amschel Rothschild himself emerges from the shadows of the Judengasse.</p><p>Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), patriarch of the Rothschild clan, fathered five illustrious sons who made the family name a by-word for banking, fabulous wealth, and Jewish philanthropy. Israeli historian Elon has pieced together the story of the dynasty&#39;s founding father, largely unrecorded heretofore. Mayer Amschel spent his life traveling between the humble Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt and the mansions of the prosperous Gentiles whom he served, particularly that of Prince Wilhelm of Hesse. Jews were severely restricted in most areas of their lives, and Rothschild had to conduct himself with appropriate servility in the presence of his masters. However, the displacements of the Napoleonic Wars gave the discreet Rothschild his chance to act as Wilhelm&#39;s agent, and his monopoly on the disbursement of the prince&#39;s loans was his entry into banking. It was all the start he needed."Well, nobody gets anything for nothing," Mayer Amschel Rothschild wrote from Frankfurt to his 19-year-old son Jacob (soon to be James) in Paris. Learning his lessons well, the brilliant, energetic Jacob would outwit Napoleon's fiscal watchdogs, bankroll his nemesis, Wellington, to the immense profit of the Rothschilds and assist in the undoing of Bonapartist France. The elder Rothschild, born in Frankfurt's crowded, rank Judengasse ghetto in which he lived all his life, would leave his five indefatigable sons his vast fortune and his even vaster pride. Much of his correspondence and papers have disappeared; in 1938, the Nazis even attempted to destroy his tombstone, and the crescent of tenements in which he lived and worked with his shrewd, sturdy wife, Guttle, burned in several conflagrations. No portrait of him exists. Yet out of what survives in documentation and in the memories of contemporaries, Jerusalem-based journalist Elon (Herzl: A Biography) has reconstructed the remarkable life of the creator of a banking empire that flourished despite a pervasive anti-Semitism that denied Frankfurt Jews even the right to leave their walled-in dwellings at night. Born in 1744, Rothschild began as a teenage dealer in foreign coins and later branched into every aspect of money exchange, financing sovereigns, merchants and armies. Posting his sons to other financial centers, he had established, by his death in 1812, a European banking empire. Filling in documentary gaps with 57 evocative illustrations, many of them contemporary, Elon has fashioned a brief but memorable first biography of a near-mythical founding father. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World Studies: Student Activities</h2><p>This is the student book, is used in good condition and has about 10% of pages written in or filled in.</p><p></p><h2>The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum</h2><p>Once there was a girl who lived in a castle.

The castle is lovely, and the girl has her own toys inside, but she&#x2019;s lonely when the children leave. Her dreams take her to visit a boy in the deep woods or&nbsp;in search of&nbsp;a friend waiting to play:&nbsp;Sometimes she even dreams about you. The story, which on its own seems thin and even odd, is elevated by the breathtaking illustrations executed in acrylic, featuring clay models that give the artwork depth and weight. Digital nhancements&nbsp;provide&nbsp;the pictures with an airbrushed smoothness that is expecially effective&nbsp;in the close-ups of the children, and the use of unusual perspectives adds to the feelings of mystery and&nbsp;longing in the book. Enticed&nbsp;by the art to enter this dreamy world, children will contemplate the nature of reality evoked by the girl&#x2019;s life.

Haykin,</strong> Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Jones has offered the church a real gift in this book. His methodology is governed not only by the wise conviction that theology and application go together but also by the unwavering belief that to know God one must gaze upon his fullest self-revelation in Christ. In this light, he offers an accessible treatment of the divine attributes written not for academics but for faithful laity seeking to consider the wonder of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kelly M. Kapic,</strong> author, <em>Embodied Hope</em>; Professor of Theological Studies, Covenant College</p><p>&#x201c;Given the preoccupation in some evangelical circles with discovering the &#x2018;practical&#x2019; outcome of every text, it is refreshing to have a book that enables us to simply contemplate and consider the nature and attributes of the God who is there. Never has evangelicalism been so confused or divided over that One who is the center and substance of our confessed faith. Never has there been such a clear need for every believer to sit down and examine and worship what has been revealed of the God who has saved us through his gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Liam Goligher,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Minister, Tenth Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; author, <em>The Jesus Gospel</em></p><p>&#x201c;God is strangely absent from much contemporary Christ-centered preaching. This absence reflects not only a theological deficit but also a truncated view of Christ and the gospel. Mark Jones&#x2019;s devotional guide to the attributes of God is therefore a welcome contribution to the libraries of both pastor and layperson. <i>God Is</i> reliably unfolds the perfections of our triune God as revealed in Holy Scripture and confessed by the church, and it traces the various rays of God&#x2019;s perfections as they shine forth in the face of Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Scott R.

If any contemporary book deserves the status of a sequel to Packer&#x2019;s <i>Knowing God</i> and the author&#x2019;s own <i>Knowing Christ</i>, this is it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Shao Kai Tseng,</strong>&nbsp;Research Professor, Department of Philosophy, Zhejiang University; author, <em>Karl Barth&#x2019;s Infralapsarian Theology</em>; contributor, <em>Oxford Handbook of Nineteenth-Century Christian Thought</em></p><p>&#x201c;Mark Jones continues to prove to be an especially reliable, pastoral guide in doctrine for the broader church. In the spirit of the great Puritan tradition&#x2015;from which he so ably quotes&#x2015;Jones once again melds depth and devotion, precision and passion, further proving J. I. Packer&#x2019;s axiom that &#x2018;true theology is for doxology.&#x2019; Read <i>God Is</i> slowly, meditatively, with prayer, with others&#x2015;and see if your thoughts of God are not greatly enlarged, reinvigorated, and warmed.

He died in 2009.</p>The Time It Never Rained<br>Chapter One&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>RIO SECO WAS TOO SMALL TO AFFORD A PROFESSIONAL manager for its one-room Chamber of Commerce. The part-time volunteer, elected because no one else wanted the job, made his living selling an independent brand of gasoline two cents under the majors though he bought it from the same tank truck that serviced half the stations in town. A man of wit, some people thought, he had erected a big red-and-white sign on the highway at the city limits:WELCOME TO RIO SECO HOME OF 3,000 FRIENDLY PEOPLE--AND THREE OLD CRANKS!Farther inside the city limits, half-hidden between a Ford billboard and one for Pepsi-Cola, he had placed another sign:THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY DON'T DRIVE THROUGH IT LIKE HELLThis cattle, sheep, and farming town was much the same as fifty others dotted along the interminable east-west highways which speed traffic across the great monotonous stretches of western Texas ranch country. To an impatient motorist hunting a cooler place to light before dark, these dusty little towns are all cut from the same tiresome pattern and, despite the signboard, a long way from heaven.Like most of them, Rio Seco had old roots. It had been born out of necessity, a trading place for sprawling cow outfits, for scattered sheep camps and industrious German dryland farmers who had come west with their wagons, their plows, and a compulsive will to build something. The town long ago had made its growth and found its natural level. Now it held steady, gaining no ground but losing none. Oil companies had come and punched their holes and found them dry. They had gone again, leaving dreams of quick riches to drift away on the arid wind like the cotton-white clouds that promised rain and failed to deliver.Life still depended on two fundamentals: crops planted by the hand of man and grass planted by the hand of God.<i>Give us rain</i>, they said at Rio Seco, <i>and it makes no difference who is in the White House</i>.If one thing set the town apart, it was probably the trees--pale-green mesquites and massive, gnarled live oaks, rustling cottonwoods and shady pecans, watered by a hundred windmills whose towers stood tall above a timid skyline. Modern municipal mains provided purer water for drinking and cooking, but most of the older generation clung to wells for yards and gardens and trees. For a man who has often turned his face to the hot breath of drouth, the sight of a windmill tower--its big steel fan clanking patiently and pumping up water clear and cool--somehow reaches deep and touches something in his soul.The town had three cultures--Anglo, German, andMexican. The first two had largely merged through the years--beef and beans and apple strudel. The third remained unassimilated, except perhaps in Rio Seco's unhurried pace of living. Most of the Anglos were addicted to Mexican food, and most of the Mexicans loved football, but these were superficial things.Many of the older rock homes had a no-nonsense squared-off solidity the Germans had brought from their original settlements in the Pedernales River section of the hill country. Across the railroad tracks, beyond roads dusty from passage of livestock trucks on their way to the shipping pens, lay the Mexican part of town--ageless adobes and small frame shacks, and a fair number of modern GI houses built since the war. The old and the new stood side by side in sharp contrast: a wrinkled, ancient Mexican working up adobe bricks out of straw and mud in a barefoot method known to the fathers of his grandfathers, while next door a three-man crew with electric saws cut raw lumber for a new frame house. Two small brown-faced boys sat on a forebearing Mexican burro, their black eyes alive with curiosity as they watched an older brother tuning the motor of a hotrod.For the ranchman, business centered around Emmett Rodale's old stone bank and Jim Sweet's feedstore-wool warehouse, a long, cool, cavernous building of concrete tile. There in round, well-packed jute bags wedged between steel poles and stacked nearly to the high ceiling lay stored the gray-white fleeces that for three generations had been a cornerstone of Rio Seco's economy.For the farmer, business focused on the same bank, the cotton gin and a small grain elevator with twin steel tubes that stood taller than anything else in town except the sun-catching silver water tower emblazoned with crudely painted red letters: SRS '51.In the second floor of the rock-fronted courthouse was a room which in recent years had emerged as another important economic fact of life: the county office of the federal PMA. Next to rain, perhaps, it had become the <i>most</i>important fact. Here the man of the land came to declare his crop acreage, his past year's plantings. Here he was told how much land he would be allowed to seed in cotton, in grain sorghums, in whatever other crops might be under federal control. Here he came for price support and to receive checks to help him pay for terraces and water-spreading, for water wells and surface tanks, for battling back the prickly pear and thorny mesquite.Here he sold his freedom bit by bit, and was paid for it on the installment plan.March Nicholson, the county PMA officer, stood at the open window, looking down on the freshly mowed courthouse lawn, the buried sprinkler system showering green bermuda grass dotted by patches of dying winter rye. It always irritated him the way people parked haphazardly around the courthouse curb, ignoring the town ordinances, if indeed there were any. Across the street under a live-oak tree, half blocking the driveway to Nicholson's rented home, stood a pickup truck with a Hereford cow tied in the sideboarded bed and a saddled horse in an open-topped trailer hitched behind it. Horse droppings had tumbled over the tailgate and onto the ground; Nicholson would have to use his shovel tonight. He cursed under his breath. In the back of another pickup waited two Border Collie sheepdogs, resting but alert-eyed, watching a farmer pull up in a bobtail truck with two big tractor tires and several sacks of planting seed.Nicholson's baleful eye was pulled away from the horse droppings by a brush-scarred green pickup pulling into an open parking space."Well, I'll be damned. I wish you'd look who's come to the meeting."His district supervisor pushed to his feet from a chair in the courtroom's jury box where he had slouched to read a copy of the morning San Angelo paper. He watched a heavy, graying ranchman step out of the pickup and limp up the concrete sidewalk toward the front steps of the courthouse. He saw nothing which made that man lookdifferent from the couple of dozen stockmen and farmers already gossiping in the courtroom."I don't know him. Is he somebody special?""He's Charlie Flagg."The name meant nothing to the supervisor. "One of the rich ones?" he guessed. In this part of the country it was often hard to tell the rich man from the poor one by looking at him. The rich man was as likely to be wearing patched trousers and runover boots as the most destitute Mexican cowboy in town. One could not afford to put up a front and the other did not have to.Nicholson shook his head. "No, not rich. Charlie Flagg is one of those operators in the middle ground ... smaller than a lot of them. You've seen that sign on the edge of town, the one about the three old cranks? Charlie Flagg is Crank Number One."The supervisor watched the ranchman pause on the front steps to swap howdies with a deputy sheriff. The deputy, who probably did not swing a leg across a horse's back twice a year, was dressed in a neatly tailored Western shirt and tight-legged cowboy pants, shiny high-heeled boots and a nicely creased Stetson hat. The rancher, probably on horseback half his waking hours, wore a nondescript straw hat beaten badly out of shape and a pair of old black boots, his baggy khaki trousers stuffed carelessly into their tops. There was a lesson in this somewhere, the supervisor thought; someday he was going to reason it out."Gives you trouble, does he, March?""No trouble ... or anything else. Never sticks his hard head into my office. He's one of those old mosshorns who thinks he made it all by himself and he doesn't need anybody. I've tried to get him to go into some of our programs. You ought to hear him snort. Says the government didn't help him when he was getting started and he doesn't need it now.""Then I'd simply forget about him if I were you. Some people you can't change; you just have to outlive them.""Charlie Flagg is too contrary to die; he'll outlive us all."Nicholson's face twisted as he looked at the men who sat in little groups scattered around the big courtroom, talking weather and crops and prices. He had sent out five hundred postcards announcing the meeting; this looked like about all the crowd he was going to get."It's frustrating," he complained. "A man devotes his life to service, and this is the response they give him. Sometimes I wish I was selling cars in San Antonio."The supervisor said, "The rest'll come in when it's time to get their checks."Nicholson walked down the aisle and out into the hallway to see if there were any laggards. He saw Charlie Flagg come up the steps, laboring a little because of a slightly game leg. Part of a postcard stuck out of one shirt pocket. Nicholson shoved his hand forward. "Mister Flagg, when I sent you that card I had no hope you would actually come to the meeting."Flagg gripped Nicholson's hand hard enough to bring a stab of pain, but he looked puzzled. "Meetin'? What meetin'?""The meeting to explain the changes in the farm program."Flagg shrugged his heavy shoulders. "They change the farm program the way I change socks. Before you can get your meetin' over with, they'll be callin' you from Washington to tell you it's all different."Nicholson sagged a little. "You didn't come for the meeting, then?"Flagg shook his head. "I come up huntin' the judge. They sent me a call for jury duty and I got a shearin' crew comin' tomorrow. Court can wait, but a shearin' crew won't."Nicholson saw that the postcard in Flagg's pocket was not the one he had mailed. "Well, I still say you'll be in to see me someday, Mister Flagg."Flagg's gaze was steady and without compromise. "What I can't do for myself, I'll do without."A short, stocky ranchman came up the stairs in time to catch the last of it. He paused to spit a long stream of brown tobacco juice at a hallway cuspidor, getting most of it in. "You're preachin' again, Charlie," he grinned, "and this ain't even church."Charlie Flagg turned, a little embarrassed. "Hello, Rounder. I didn't go to preach, but he asked me and I told him."Rounder Pike laid a rough hand on Flagg's shoulder. "You're fartin' against the wind, Charlie. We've got used to government money like a kid gets used to candy. Most people wouldn't quit takin' it now. Them as did would go right on payin' the same old taxes and not get nothin' back. We're like a woman that's been talked into a little taste of sin and found out she likes it. You'd just as well join the crowd. You're payin' the freight anyway.""Never."<i>"Never</i> is an awful long time." Pike gripped Flagg's shoulder, then walked on into the courtroom.Nicholson motioned toward the door. "There's plenty of room, Mister Flagg."Flagg started to turn away. "You'll find, Mister Nicholson, that ranchers are contrary people. And <i>old</i> ranchers are <i>awful</i> contrary." He limped down the hall toward the office of the county judge.Nicholson's supervisor had come out into the hallway to listen. He said, "One of those <i>rugged individualists,</i> isn't he?""Someday he'll just be a <i>ragged</i> individualist. He's standing still while time goes on by. But he'll be in to see me one of these days. He'll come in like all the rest."The supervisor frowned, watching the rancher go through an open door. "Somehow, I hope he never does."Nicholson's eyebrows went up.The supervisor said, "He's gone out of style, but theworld will be a poorer place when it loses the last of his kind.""You sympathize with him?""I pity him, a little. A man can get awfully lonesome standing out there all by himself."Copyright � 1973, 1984 by Elmer Kelton</p><h2>Poison Ivy: A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery (Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mysteries)</h2><p><p>On her first day as adjunct professor at Ivy Green College, Victoria Trumbull recognizes the stench emanating from her classroom as more than just dead mice.

In a book containing a large proportion of dialogue, Peter S. Beagle's best work as a narrator comes through some of his characterizations. Rebeck and his widow, Mrs. Clapper, are as finely performed as they are written. The ghosts and raven, however, fall somewhat flat. Overall, the author's performance comes across as understated and depressing, qualities not at all helpful in dealing with the premise of the book, farfetched in its own right.

He was mobbed everywhere he went. His clothes were regularly ripped off by adoring fans. He sold records the world over. He was bigger than Elvis. And all thanks to a hit TV show called <i>The Partridge Family</i>.&nbsp;David Cassiday, in his own words,&nbsp;gives a brutally frank account of those mindblowing days of stardom in which being David Cassidy played second fiddle to being Keith Partridge.&nbsp;Including&nbsp;stories of sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll that explode the myth of Cassidy as squeaky clean, it is also the story of how to keep on living life and loving yourself&nbsp;when the fickle fans fall away. David Cassidy is also the author of <i>C'mon, Get Happy: Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus.&nbsp;</i></p><p>In 1970, after a brief acting career on Broadway and with various guest appearances on American TV shows,&nbsp;<i>The Partridge Family</i> catapulted David Cassidy to fame. At the age of 20, his face was on the cover of every teenage magazine. He became an&nbsp;international pop star. In 1974, his exhausting schedule took its toll on the quality of his life. After a 15 year absence, David has returned to concert stages across the country and the world.

His research brought to light details of Picasso's life that had always remained hidden from the general public. These details are now revealed exclusively in this book. The author explains why certain myths have grown up around modern art's founder and he rebuts the slanderous attacks made against Picasso in the past. Picasso's grandson spoke to the people who really knew his grandfather - famous contemporaries and leading figures from the worlds of art and the law, as well as ordinary individuals who played a part in his life. The author paints an intimate portrait of the artist and provides a delicate counterbalance to the public perception of the artist.<br>The author describes Picasso's relationships with the women in his life and his children and examines his views on love, sex, and family life, as well as money, politics, power, fame, death, and eternity. This book reveals the story of one man's life and dispels many of the myths that surround the prolific artist and insatiable man. For the first time, the reader is let into the secrets of the Picasso estate with its eventful history and the incredible value of the inheritance.</p><p>Olivier Widmaier Picasso is the son of Maya, the daughter of Pablo Picasso and Marie-Therese Walter. He studied law and works in Paris as a producer and media consultant.Olivier Widmaier-Picasso, a grandson of the famous artist, offers a measured blend of research and interpretation and works to counter certain darker, scandal-driven portrayals of his grandfather, including two books by his cousin, Marina Picasso. Olivier's Picasso is a generous humanist and a "multicolored alternative to a world of gray certitudes." Because his mother, Maya, was born to Picasso and longtime lover Marie-Therese Walter, Olivier, a lawyer and media producer, spends much time detailing the evolution of French laws of paternity and inheritance, the seven-year proceedings to settle the artist's $840 million estate, and the efforts since to promote and protect the Picasso brand. His thematic structure-- chapters on women, politics, family, money--leads to inevitable backtracking but allows him to focus at length on the private entanglements of a most public man. The Bohemian poverty, the uneasy days in Vichy France, the communism, the worldwide fame: it's all told with a sense of family pride. <i>Steve Paul</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although briefly interrupted in the late 1970s and temporarily reversed in the 1990s, a powerful surge from the right has dominated American politics and government. In <em>The Age of Reagan</em>, Sean Wilentz accounts for how a conservative movement once deemed marginal managed to seize power and hold it, and the momentous consequences that followed. </p><p>Ronald Reagan has been the single most important political figure of this age. Without Reagan, the conservative movement would have never been as successful as it was. In his political persona as well as his policies, Reagan embodied a new fusion of deeply right-leaning politics with some of the rhetoric and even a bit of the spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and John F. Kennedy's New Frontier. In American political history there have been a few leading figures who, for better or worse, have placed their political stamp indelibly on their times. They include Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2014;and Ronald Reagan. A conservative hero in a conservative age, Reagan has been so admired by a minority of historians and so disliked by the others that it has been difficult to evaluate his administration with detachment. Drawing on numerous primary documents that have been neglected or only recently released to the public, as well as on emerging historical work, Wilentz offers invaluable revelations about conservatism's ascendancy and the era in which Reagan was the preeminent political figure. </p><p>Vivid, authoritative, and illuminating from start to finish, <em>The Age of Reagan</em> raises profound questions and opens passionate debate about our nation's recent past.</p></p><p><p>Sean Wilentz is the author of <em>The Rise of American Democracy</em>, which won the Bancroft Prize and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Wilentz teaches American history at Princeton University. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>Starred Review. Distinguished Princeton historian Wilentz-winner of a Bancroft Prize for <i>The Rise of American Democracy</i>-makes an eloquent and compelling case for America's Right as the defining factor shaping the country's political history over the past 35 years. Wilentz argues that the unproductive liberalism of the Carter years was a momentary pause in a general tidal surge toward a new politics of conservatism defined largely by the philosophy and style of Ronald Reagan. Even Bill Clinton, he shows, tacitly admitted the ascendance of many Reaganesque core values in the American mind by styling himself as a centrist "New Democrat" and moving himself and his party to the right. Wilentz postulates Reagan as the perfect man at the ideal moment, not just ruling his eight years in the White House, but also casting a long shadow on all that followed (a shadow, one might add, still being felt in the Republican presidential campaign today). While examining in detail the low points of Reagan's presidency, from Iran-Contra to his initial belligerence toward the Soviet Union, Wilentz concludes in his superb account that Reagan must be considered one of the great presidents: he reshaped the geopolitical map of the world as well as the American judiciary and bureaucracy, and uplifted an American public disheartened by Vietnam and the grim Carter years. While much has been written by Reagan admirers, Wilentz says, "his achievement looks much more substantial than anything the Reagan mythmakers have said in his honor." 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bach</h2><p>This superb reference work on Johann Sebastian Bach is the first volume in a new species of Oxford Companion that will focus on major composers. <br> Illustrated with twenty-four black-and-white plates, this volume boasts over a thousand alphabetically arranged entries that cover Bach's music, his life and times, scholarship on Bach, and the performance of his music. Readers will find entries on the various genres that Bach worked in (including chorales, fantasia, sonata, concerto, missa), his many individual works (such as St. John's Passion, The Goldberg Variations, Brandenburg Concertos, Passacaglia, Well-Tempered Clavier, The Christmas Oratorio, and The Art of Fugue), places important to his career (such as Muhlhausen, Weimar, and Leipzig), and important contemporaries (Handel, Rameau, Vivaldi, Telemann, among others). There are also entries on instruments (harpsichord, organ, clavier, and so on), Bach performance practice, stylistic influences on his work, and other biographical details. The book concludes with a family tree, a chronology of Bach's life, a list of his works, and a glossary of terms. <br> Bach was one of the giants of classical music, a composer of astonishing powers of invention. In <em>The Oxford Composer Companion: J.S. Bach</em>, music aficionados will have at their fingertips a treasure chest of information on this major figure.</p><p><br><strong>Malcolm Boyd</strong> is the author of numerous books on music, particularly on Bach.

Edited by the noted Bach scholar Boyd, this first English-language <i>A^-Z</i> encyclopedia on Bach has more than 900 entries written by 44 contributors. The contributors are well chosen, writing on their interests--Russell Stinson wrote the entry on the <i>Orgel-Buchlein</i> ("Little Organ Book") and has also completed a book on the same collection of organ chorales. The consultant editor is John Butt, who edited <i>The</i> <i>Cambridge Companion to Bach</i> (1997), which includes essays on Bach's life and works as well as on his influence on modern music.<p>The Oxford volume provides short and long entries, many with bibliographies, on aspects of Bach's life, family, pupils, and employers; musical and technical terms; and individual works. Short articles include descriptions of <i>cadenza fantasia, timpani,</i> and <i>watermarks.</i> There are also a number of entries for current Bach festivals and twentieth-century musicians noted for Bach interpretations, such as Glenn Gould and Nikolaus Harnoncourt.</p><p>Extensive essays cover Bach's major works (<i>Brandenburg Concerto, Mass in B Minor</i>) and types of compositions (<i>chorale</i>, <i>fugue</i>). One of the longest entries, <i>reception and revival, </i>surveys Bach's impact on various national musical traditions. Another discusses recordings. Black-and-white illustrations of Bach, his sons, places important in his life, a family tree, manuscripts of his works, and a map of his Germany enhance the text. Appendixes list Bach's works by category and title both with BC (<i>Bach Compendium</i>) and BWV (<i>Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis</i>) catalogue numbers. A "Thematic Overview" at the beginning of the volume lists entries by topic.

At the same time, she can't shake the fact that she is the daughter of two back-to-the-land hippies who taught her to love nature and eat vegetables. Ambivalent about repeating her parents' disastrous mistakes, yet drawn to the idea of backyard self-sufficiency, Carpenter decided that it might be possible to have it both ways: a homegrown vegetable plot as well as museums, bars, concerts, and a twenty-four-hour convenience mart mere minutes away. Especially when she moved to a ramshackle house in inner city Oakland and discovered a weed-choked, garbage-strewn abandoned lot next door. She closed her eyes and pictured heirloom tomatoes, a beehive, and a chicken coop.<br><br> What started out as a few egg-laying chickens led to turkeys, geese, and ducks. Soon, some rabbits joined the fun, then two three-hundred-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals weren't pets; she was a farmer, not a zookeeper. Novella was raising these animals for dinner. Novella Carpenter's corner of downtown Oakland is populated by unforgettable characters. Lana (<i>anal</i> spelled backward, she reminds us) runs a speakeasy across the street and refuses to hurt even a fly, let alone condone raising turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bobby, the homeless man who collects cars and car parts just outside the farm, is an invaluable neighborhood concierge. The turkeys, Harold and Maude, tend to escape on a daily basis to cavort with the prostitutes hanging around just off the highway nearby. Every day on this strange and beautiful farm, urban meets rural in the most surprising ways.<br><br> For anyone who has ever grown herbs on their windowsill, tomatoes on their fire escape, or obsessed over the offerings at the local farmers' market, Carpenter's story will capture your heart. And if you've ever considered leaving it all behind to become a farmer outside the city limits, or looked at the abandoned lot next door with a gleam in your eye, consider this both a cautionary tale and a full-throated call to action.<i> Farm City</i> is an unforgettably charming memoir, full of hilarious moments, fascinating farmers' tips, and a great deal of heart. It is also a moving meditation on urban life versus the natural world and what we have given up to live the way we do.</p><p>Novella Carpenter grew up in rural Idaho and Washington State. She went to University of Washington in Seattle where she majored in Biology and English. She later studied under Michael Pollan at Berkeley&#x2019;s Graduate School of Journalism for two years. She&#x2019;s had many odd jobs including: assassin bug handler, book editor, media projectionist, hamster oocyte collector, and most recently, journalist. Her writing has appeared in Salon.com, Saveur.com, sfgate.com (the <i>SF Chronicle</i>'s website), and <i>Mother Jones</i>. She has been cultivating her farm in the city for over ten years now, and her neighbors still think she&#x2019;s crazy. It all started with a few chickens, then some bees, until she had a full-blown farm near downtown Oakland, where she lives today.Highways roared in the distance. Gunshots could be heard a few blocks away. And a homeless man slept in an abandoned car down the street. Among these modern-day urban scenes, author Novella Carpenter put down roots--literally--turning a vacant lot in Oakland, California, into a working mini-farm, complete with vegetables, herbs, chickens, ducks, and bees. Karen White reads these lively accounts of missteps and delicious victories, including recipes, with the author&#39;s intelligence, humor, and devotion to the American ideal of hard work and self-sufficiency. Farming is about food, and food is always about people. Carpenter&#39;s encounters with third-world neighbors, block parties, and the boy who came to buy a rabbit are beguiling and inspiring. B.P. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Bob Dylan: The Brazil Series</h2><p>Bob Dylan has been a prolific graphic artist since the 1960s, and his graphic art is marked by the same constant drive for renewal that characterises his music. Never content to remain static in a single form of expression that he has already cultivated, he is constantly experimenting and testing new artistic techniques and expressions. This book of the exhibition at the National Gallery of Denmark encompasses some 100 works, including completely new works to be seen in public for the first time. Bob Dylan has recently delved into painting in acrylic, and the exhibition is the first to document this new direction in the artist&#39;s work, showing larger format paintings alongside drawings. Dylan&#39;s works are often created during his exhaustive touring, and his motifs bear corresponding imprints of the environments and people that he crosses in his life. As a graphic artist he functions as a phenomenal observer who depicts the immediately banal and everyday facets of life in such a way that they appear fresh and new for the viewer.</p><p>Following on the heels of Drawn Blank, which The New York Times hailed as &#x201c;extraordinary&#x201d; and &#x201c;enthralling,&#x201d; this volume of Dylan&#x2019;s paintings includes works created since 2008. Inspired by his travels in Brazil, the paintings embody an array of motifs, from portraits to landscapes, highly narrative scenes to brilliant experiments with composition and color. The subjects of The Brazil Series include workers, boxers, entertainers, and socialites, together capturing many facets of Brazilian life. This volume includes perceptive essays that introduce readers to Dylan&#x2019;s decades-long interest in drawing and painting; trace elements of that passion within his musical career; and offer a thoughtful analysis of these most recent works. Brilliant reproductions reveal the artist&#x2019;s extraordinary use of color and line, while details of the paintings allow readers to further appreciate Dylan&#x2019;s sophistication as an artist and his lifelong exploration of people and the worlds they inhabit.Bob Dylan has been a prolific graphic artist since the 1960s, and his graphic art is marked by the same constant drive for renewal that characterises his music.</p><h2>The Great Gatsby: Scott F. Fitzgerald (Penguin F Scott Fitzgerald Hardback Collection)</h2><p><p>These sumptuous new hardback editions mark the 70th anniversary of Fitzgerald's death.</p><p>Jay Gatsby is the man who has everything. Everybody who is anybody is seen at his glittering parties. Day and night his Long Island mansion buzzes with bright young things drinking, dancing and debating his mysterious character. For Gatsby - young, handsome, fabulously rich - always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, though no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret: a silent longing for the one thing that will always be out of his reach. And soon this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.</p></p><p>In 1922, F Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple, intricately patterned". That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear. When s he does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbour Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem. <i>Perry Freeman, Amazon.com</i></p>"It&#x2019;s an absolute gem and stands head and shoulders above the others.

(<i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"<i>Gatsby</i> is a connoisseur's guide to the glamour and glitter of the Jazz Age, but it's also a nearly prophetic glimpse into the world to come. Writing at the height of the boom, in the midst of the Roaring Twenties, Fitzgerald detected the ephemerality, fakery and corruption always lurking at the heart of the great American success story... A haunting meditation on aspiration, disillusionment, romantic love - and a blistering expos� of the materialism, duplicity, and sexual politics driving what Fitzgerald calls America's true "business": "the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"" (<i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"It is a marvellously suggestive novel...a parable of modern America, and by extension of modern life" (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"The first and greatest modern novel, it has beautiful women, lavish parties, romance, betrayal and murder woven together in an intricately structured plot.

The couple in "Adults Alone," whose children have been left with a grandmother for a few days, descend into mindless torpor and crack-smoking. Reality returns with the news that their boys are coming home early. In "Jim Train," a character whose office is unexpectedly closed also finds himself slipping off the edge of self-definition. Homes's characters need to hang on to the safety of their everyday lives, and the point that reverberates through these fictions is how tenuous a hold they actually have. In "A Real Doll," a teenage boy has a series of erotic encounters with his little sister's Barbie doll: "I'm Tropical, she said, the same way a person might say I'm Catholic or I'm Jewish."stet punctuation.eed Ken, she complains, "Is not what you'd call well-endowed. . . . All he's got is a little plastic bump." After an even more bizarre sexual liaison with Ken, the narrator becomes disenchanted with Barbie, who has been mutilated by her owner. Though occasionally given to straining for shocking effect, Homes has here demonstrated a quirky and original flair. QPB selection. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.If it is Homes's aim to capture our attention by shocking us with her outrageousness, then she surely succeeds. But shock and outrage eventually wear off and leave us feeling manipulated. This is a collection of puerile sexual fantasies disguised as short stories, and Homes seems to expect us to explode (or, like Pavlov's dogs, at least to salivate) at her explicit descriptions of juvenile sexual exploration. "A Real Doll" is a young boy's fantasy about his affair with his sister's Barbie doll. "Chunky in Heat" is about a very fat young girl having sexual fantasies on a lawn chair in her backyard. "The I of It" is about a young man who is obsessed by, and furious at, his penis. Homes has the talent to pull us into her quirky world, but that world is full of nothing but sex: fear of it, desire for it, revulsion from it, and endless, endless fantasy about it. If Homes would stop doing her outrageous act, she could use her considerable talent to capture our attention quietly and with some depth.<br><i>- Marcia Tager, Tenafly, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Royal Flash (The Flashman Papers)</h2><p>In Volume II of the Flashman Papers, Flashman tangles with femme fatale Lola Montez and the dastardly Otto Von Bismarck in a battle of wits which will decide the destiny of a continent.

The warmth and brightness of the rising sun was entirely screened away by low cloud banks and heavy mist that settled into the ominous heights and did not stir. The winds blew with vicious force over the barren rocks, whipping through canyons and craggy drops, across slopes and ridges, cutting into the scant vegetation and bending it close to the point of breaking, yet slipping through the mixture of clouds and mist with elusive quickness, leaving it unexplainably and strangely motionless. The sound of the wind was like the deep roar of the ocean breaking on an open beach, heavy and rolling, blanketing the empty peaks in a peculiar drone that, when one had been enveloped for a while, created its own level of silence. Birds rose and fell with the wind, their cries scattered and muffled. There were few animals at this height--isolated herds of a particularly tough breed of mountain goat and small, furry mice that inhabited the innermost recesses of the rocks. The air was more than chill; it was bitterly cold. Snow covered the upper reaches of the Dragon's Teeth, and changes in the seasons had little effect at this altitude on a temperature that seldom reached thirty degrees.<br><br>These were treacherous mountains, vast, towering and incredibly massive. On this morning they seemed shrouded with a strange expectancy, and the eight men who comprised the little company from Culhaven could not ignore the feeling of uneasiness that preoccupied their thoughts as they trudged deeper into the cold and the gray. It was more than the disturbing prophecy of Bremen or even the knowledge that they would soon attempt to pass through the forbidden Hall of Kings. Something was waiting for them, something that had patience and cunning, a life force that lay hidden in the barren, rocky terrain they were passing through, filled with vindictive hatred of them, watching as they struggled deeper into the giant mountains that shut away the ancient kingdom of Paranor. They trudged northward in a ragged line, strung out against the misty skyline, their bodies wrapped tightly in woolen cloaks for protection against the cold, their faces bent before the wind. The slopes and canyons were covered with loose rock and split by hidden crevices that made the footing extremely hazardous. More than once, a member of the little band went down in a shower of loose rock and dirt. But still the thing concealed in the land chose not to show itself, content merely to let its presence be known and to wait for the effect of that knowledge to wear away at the resistance of the eight men. The hunters would then become the hunted.<br><br>It did not take long. Doubts began to gnaw quietly, persistently at their tired minds--doubts that rose phantomlike from the fears and secrets the men concealed deep within. Locked away from one another by the cold and the roar of the rising wind, each man was cut off from his companions, and the inability to communicate only heightened the growing feeling of uneasiness. Only Hendel was immune. His taciturn, solitary nature had hardened him against self-doubt, and his harrowing escape from the maddened Gnomes in the Pass of Jade had drained him at least temporarily of any fear of death. He had come close to dying, so close that in the end only instinct had saved him. The Gnomes had come at him from every direction, swarming up the slope in reckless disregard, enraged to the point where only bloodshed would quiet their hatred. He had been quick, slipping back into the fringes of the Wolfsktaag, motionless in the brush, coolly letting the Gnomes overextend themselves until one had come within reach. It had taken only seconds to stun the unsuspecting hunter, to cloak his captive in his own distinctive Dwarf habit, and then yell for assistance. In the darkness, flushed with the excitement of the hunt, the Gnomes were unable to recognize anything except the cloak. They tore their own brother to pieces without realizing it. Hendel had stayed hidden and slipped through the pass the following day. He had survived once again.<br><br>The Valemen and the Elves did not possess Hendel's strong sense of self-reliance. The prophecy of the Shade of Bremen had left them stunned. The words seemed to repeat themselves over and over in the howl of the mountain winds. One of them was going to die. Oh, the words of the prophecy had phrased it differently than that, but the implication was unmistakable. It was a bitter prospect to face, and none of them could really accept it. Somehow they would find a way to prove the prediction wrong.<br><br>Far in the lead, his great frame bent against the driving force of the mountain winds, Allanon was mulling over the events that had transpired in the Valley of Shale. He considered for the hundredth time his strange confrontation with the Shade of Bremen, the aged Druid doomed to wander in limbo until the Warlock Lord was finally destroyed. Yet it was not the appearance of the driven wraith that so disturbed him now. It was the terrible knowledge which he carried, buried deep among his blackest truths. His foot struck a projecting rock, causing him to stumble slightly, and he fought to keep his balance. A wheeling hawk screamed shrilly in the grayness and shot down out of the sky over a distant ridge. The Druid turned slightly as the thin line following struggled to keep pace. He had learned more from the Shade than the words of the prophecy. But he had not told the others, those who had trusted him, the whole truth, just as he had not told them the whole story behind the legendary Sword of Shannara. His deep-set eyes blazed with inner fury at the predicament in which he had placed himself in not telling them everything, and for a moment he even considered doing so. They had given so much of themselves, and the giving had only begun. . . . But a moment later, he wrenched the idea from his thoughts. Necessity was a higher god than truth.<br><br>The grayness of dawn passed slowly into the grayness of midday, and the march into the Dragon's Teeth wore on. The ridges and slopes appeared and faded with a dreary sameness that created the impression in the minds of the laboring travelers that no progress was being made. Ahead, a vast, towering line of peaks rose bleakly against the misty northern horizon, and it appeared that they were moving directly into a wall of impenetrable stone. Then they entered a broad canyon which wound sharply downward into a narrow, twisting path that broke between two huge cliffs and faded into the heavy mist. Allanon led them into the swirling grayness as the horizon disappeared and the wind died into stillness. The silence was abrupt and unexpected, sounding almost like a soft whisper through the towering mass of rock, speaking in hushed, cautious words in the ears of the groping travelers. Then the pass widened slightly and the mist cleared to a faint haze, revealing a high, cavernous opening in the cliff face where the winding passage ended.<br><br>The entrance to the Hall of Kings.<br><br>It was awesome, majestic, frightening. On either side of the rectangular black entryway stood two monstrous stone statues carved into the rock and rising well over a hundred feet against the dark cliff face. The stone sentries had been fashioned in the shape of armor-clad warriors, standing watchfully in the deep gloom, hands gripping the pommels of huge swords which rested blade downward at their feet. Their weathered, bearded faces were scarred by time and the wind, yet the eyes seemed almost alive, fixed carefully on the eight mortals who stood at the threshold of the ancient hall they guarded. Above the great entryway, scrolled into the rock, three words of a language centuries old and long forgotten served as a warning to those who would enter that this was the tomb of the dead. Beyond the vast opening, all was blackness and silence.<br><br>Allanon gathered them closely around him.<br><br>"Years ago, before the First War of the Races, a cult of men whose origins have been lost in time, served as priests for the gods of death. Within these caverns, they buried the monarchs of the four lands along with their families, servants, favorite possessions, and much of their wealth. The legend grew that only the dead could survive within these chambers, and only the priests were permitted to see that the dead rulers were interred. All others who entered were never seen again. In time, the cult died out, but the evil instilled in the Hall of Kings continued to exist, blindly to serve the priests whose bones had years before returned to the earth. Few men have ever passed . . ."<br><br>He caught himself, seeing in the eyes of his listeners the unasked question.<br><br>"I have been through the Hall of Kings--I alone from this age, and now you. I am a Druid, the last to walk this earth. Like Bremen, like Brona before him, I have studied the black arts, and I am a sorcerer. I do not possess the power of the Dark Lord--but I can get us safely through these caverns to the other side of the Dragon's Teeth."<br><br>"And then?" Balinor's question came softly out of the mist.<br><br>"A narrow cliff-trail men call the Dragon's Crease leads downward out of the mountains. Once there, we will be within sight of Paranor."<br><br>There was a long, awkward silence. Allanon knew what they were thinking; disregarding it, he continued.<br><br>"Beyond this entrance, there are a number of passages and chambers, a maze to one who does not know the way. Some of these are dangerous, some are not. Soon after we enter, we will reach the tunnel of the Sphinxes, giant statues like these sentries, but carved as half man, half beast. If you look into their eyes, you will be turned to stone instantly. So you must be blindfolded. In addition you will be roped to one another. You must concentrate on me, think only of me, for their will, their mental command, is strong enough to force you to tear off the blindfolds and gaze into their eyes."<br><br>The seven men looked at one another doubtfully. Already they were beginning to question the soundness of this whole approach.<br><br>"Once past the Sphinxes, there are several harmless passages leading to the Corridor of the Winds, a tunnel inhabited by invisible beings called Banshees after the legendary astral spirits. They are no more than voices, but those voices will drive mortal men insane. Your ears will be bound for protection, but again the important thing for you to do is to concentrate on me, let my mind blanket yours to prevent it from receiving the full force of those voices. You must relax; do not fight me. Do you understand?"<br><br>He counted seven barely perceptible nods.<br><br>"Once beyond the Corridor of the Winds, we will be in the Tomb of the Kings. Then there will be only one more obstacle . . ."<br><br>He stopped talking, his eyes turned warily to the cavern entrance. For a moment it seemed he might finish the sentence, but instead he motioned them toward the dark entryway. They stood uneasily between the stone giants, the graying mist clouding the high cliff walls surrounding them, the black, yawning opening before them waiting like the open maw of some great beast of prey. Allanon produced a number of wide cloth strips and gave one to each man. Utilizing a heavy length of climbing rope, the little group bound themselves to one another, the surefooted Durin taking the lead position, the Prince of Callahorn again assuming his post as rear guard. The blindfolds were securely fastened in place and hands were joined to form a chain. A moment later, the line moved cautiously through the entrance to the Hall of Kings.<br><br>There was a deep, hushed stillness in the caverns, magnified by the sudden dying of the winds and the echoing of their footfalls along the rocky passageway. The tunnel floor was strangely smooth and level, but the cold that had settled into the aged stone from centuries of constant temperatures seeped quickly through their tensed bodies and left them chill and shaking. No one spoke, each man trying to relax as Allanon led them carefully through a series of gently winding turns. In the middle of the groping line, Shea felt Flick's hand grip his own tightly in the blackness that surrounded them. They had drawn closer to each other since their flight from the Vale, bound now by ties of experiences shared more than by kinship. Whatever happened to them, Shea felt they would never lose that closeness. Nor would he forget what Menion had done for him. He thought about the Prince of Leah for a moment and found himself smiling. The highlander had changed so much during the past few days that he was almost a different person. The old Menion was still in evidence, but there was a new dimension to him that Shea found difficult to define. But then all of them, Menion, Flick, and himself, had changed in little ways that could not be readily detected until each man was considered as a whole. He wondered if Allanon had seen the changes in him--Allanon, who had always treated him somehow as less than a man, more a boy.<br><br>They came to an unsteady halt, and in the deep silence that followed the commanding voice of the Druid leader whispered soundlessly in the mind of each man: Remember my warning, let your thoughts turn to me, concentrate only on me. Then the line moved forward, the booted feet echoing hollowly on the cavern floor. Immediately the blindfolded men could sense the presence of something waiting ahead of them, watching silently, patiently. The seconds flitted away as the company moved deeper into the cavern. The men became aware of huge, still forms rising up on either side--images carved of stone with faces that were human, but attached to the crouched bodies of indescribable beasts. The Sphinxes. In their minds the men could see those eyes, burning past the fading image of Allanon, and they began to feel the strain of trying to concentrate on the giant Druid. The insistent will of the stone monsters pushed into their brains, weaving and tangling into their scattered thoughts, working tenaciously toward the moment when human eyes would meet their own lifeless gaze. Each man began to feel a rapidly growing urge to rip away the restraining cloth which shackled his sight, to strip away the darkness and gaze freely on the wondrous creatures staring silently down on him.</p><h2>Love Monkey</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>The Nigger of the `Narcissus&#39; and Other Stories</h2><p>A disturbing and powerful portrait of the sea and sea life.</p><p><b>Joseph Conrad </b>was born in Berdichev, Ukraine, in 1857.

Dr. Walter C. Willett gets off to a roaring start by totally dismantling one of the largest icons in health today: the USDA Food Pyramid that we all learn in elementary school. He blames many of the pyramid's recommendations--6 to 11 servings of carbohydrates, all fats used sparingly--for much of the current wave of obesity. At first this may read differently than any diet book, but Willett also makes a crucial, rarely mentioned point about this icon: "The thing to keep in mind about the USDA Pyramid is that it comes from the Department of Agriculture, the agency responsible for promoting American agriculture, not from the agencies established to monitor and protect our health." It's no wonder that dairy products and American-grown grains such as wheat and corn figure so prominently in the USDA's recommendations.<p> Willett's own simple pyramid has several benefits over the traditional format. His information is up-to-date, and you won't find recommendations that come from special-interest groups. His ideas are nothing radical--if we eat more vegetables and complex carbohydrates (no, potatoes are <i>not</i> complex), emphasize healthy fats, and enjoy small amounts of a tremendous variety of food, we will be healthier. You'll find some surprises as well, such as doubts about the overall benefits of soy (unless you're willing to eat a pound and a half of tofu a day), and that nuts, with their "good" fat content, are a terrific snack. Relying on research rather than anecdotes, this is a solidly written nutritional guide that will show you the real story behind how food is digested, from the glycemic index for carbs to the wisdom of adding a multivitamin to your diet. Willett combines research with matter-of-fact language and a no-nonsense tone that turns academic studies into easily understandable suggestions for living. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Walter C.

The tales were collected by Slovak scholar and cultural researcher Pavol Dobsinsky, a man of many dimensions, including poet, pastor, teacher, editor, and translator, who lived from 1828 to 1885 in that part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that would become the present-day Slovak Republic. His life-long interest in folk culture culminated in the publication of the eight-volume Popular Slovak Folk Tales. Published between 1880 and 1883, this work is the largest and most comprehensive collection of Slovak folk fairy tales in existence. It set a standard of excellence for future research, and it became an essential component in later studies of Slovak folklore. For the Slovak people, it is a national treasure. <p>Although the tales Dobsinksy collected have much in common with other European folk fairy tales, they are also uniquely Slovak. References to food (especially soup) and farming reflect the culture out of which they came, and the illustrations of the celebrated Slovak illustrator Martin Benka (1888-1971) capture the look and feel of a time long gone, especially in the characteristically Slovak clothing of the characters. But the tales also capture the more elusive qualities of Slovak culture, those that are hardest to articulate because they exist between the lines of description and dialogue and are ultimately the result of many details that intertwine and influence one another. </p><p>The tales chosen for this collection fall into three broad categories: traditional fairy tales, complete with magic spells, wicked stepmothers, multi-headed dragons, and fantastic journeys; animal tales, in which many of the principal characters are barnyard or forest creatures with human traits, including the ability to speak; and finally, what might be called folk tales, in which an ordinary individual is able to outwit a potential enemy, human or otherwise, and triumph in the end, sometimes quite by accident. Some of the tales incorporate elements of two or all three of these categories. </p><p>Folk tales and fairy tales appeal to me personally not only because the kid in me enjoys their magical and moral character, but also because the adult in me enjoys how they always say more than they seem to say and can be read on more than one level. Hence the title Slovak Tales for Young and Old. </p><p>(excerpt from the Introduction)</p></p><h2>Dead Lawyers and Other Pleasant Thoughts</h2><p>Dead Lawyers and Other Please Thoughts is the first collection the best from Non Sequitur, the sharp, sly new syndicated comic strip that has addicted fans from coast to coast. Cartoonist Wiley&#39;s irreverent, satirical wit, combined with his superbly crafted illustrations, confirm once and for all the sneaking suspicion that the universe is one big joke at humanity&#39;s expense. Non Sequitur explores the absurd and the unexpected with outrageously funny sendups of everything from the plight of the homeless to the might of defense attorneys; Dead Lawyers continues that tradition by refusing to conform to the monotonous, row-upon-row layout of most comic strip collections. As Wiley himself says, &#34;Humor knows no bounds, and neither do my cartoons.&#34;</p><p>Wiley began his career as a political cartoonist in 1976, and his incisive drawings have won him several honors, including, in 1991, the prestigious Robert F.

Reminding us that we can only take clients as far as we ourselves have been able to go, Carey reveals her own very personal involvement with the process. <br><br>She explores the application of sandplay therapy as she learned it from Dora Kalff, among others, and shares her professional experience in a chapter on equipping the office with miniatures and also with cameras (for give-away Polaroids and for record-keeping slides) touching such bottom lines as how to deal with the mess and how to handle the theft of a figure. While Carey cites case examples, complete with pictures, to illustrate her use of sandplay in working with children, she also demonstrates that the medium appeals to the inner child in the adult. Moreover, the sandbox itself sets physical and symbolic limits that enhance therapy with family members, and the sandplay becomes a forum for alliances that the clinician can observe in action and intervene to restructure. Lois Carey makes the case effortless by teaching lessons bound to be welcomed by any professional looking for new tools or open to fresh perspectives.</p><p><b>Lois Carey</b>, M.S.W., B.C.D.S.W., is a clinical social worker in private practice. She graduated from Columbia University School of Social Work, and later studied Jungian theory and Sandplay Therapy in Switzerland, California, and New York. She is a Registered Play Therapy Supervisor of the Association for Play Therapy, a board member of the New York Branch of the Association for Play Therapy, and a Registered Play Therapy Professor of the International Play Therapy Association. She is the Director of the Center for Sandplay Studies, and has lectured and taught Sandplay to professional groups throughout the United States and abroad.

There wasn't much work, so I made some sample pictures and took them to several publishers. They all rejected my work. But one editor suggested that I try writing a book of my own to illustrate. I had done a painting of a little girl with a big red dog. That seemed like a funny idea, so I made up a story about them. I increased the dog's size from as big as a horse to as big as a house. My wife named the dog Clifford, and we named the little girl Emily Elizabeth after our daughter. In three days I had written the story and drawn the pictures for Clifford The Big Red Dog.

Using his top secret clearances, Martin Anderson was able to access Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s most privileged exchanges with subordinates and world leaders as well as the tactical record of how Reagan fought to win the Cold War and control nuclear weapons. <br><br>The most revelatory of these documents are the minutes of Reagan-chaired National Security Council meetings, the dozens of secret letters sent by Reagan to world leaders, and the eyewitness notes from Reagan-Gorbachev summits. Along with these findings, the authors use Reagan&#x2019;s speeches, radio addresses, personal diaries, and other correspondence to develop a striking picture of a man whose incisive intelligence, uncanny instincts, and quiet self-confidence changed the course of history. <br><br>What emerges from this treasure trove of material is irrefutable evidence that Reagan intended from his first days in office to bring down the Soviet Union, that he considered eliminating nuclear weapons his paramount objective, and that he&#x2014;not his subordinates&#x2014;was the principal architect of the policies that ultimately brought the Soviets to the nuclear-arms negotiating table. The authors also affirm that many of Reagan&#x2019;s ideas, including his controversial &#x201c;Star Wars&#x201d; missile-defense initiative, proved essential in dissolving the Soviet Union and keeping America safe.<br><br>Riveting and eye-opening, <i>Reagan&#x2019;s Secret War</i> provides a front-row seat to history, a journey into the political mind of a remarkable leader, and proof that one man can, through the force of his deep convictions, bring about sweeping global change.</p><p>MARTIN ANDERSON and ANNELISE ANDERSON, husband and wife, are coauthors of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Reagan, In His Own Hand; Reagan: A Life in Letters</i>; and <i>Reagan&#x2019;s Path to Victory</i>. Both are Fellows at the Hoover Institution. Martin, an M.I.T. Ph.D., worked in the Reagan White House as an economic policy adviser and, more recently, sat on the Pentagon&#x2019;s defense-policy board.

He doesn't let anybody get too close. There's a wall around him. -Nancy Reagan, 1989<br><br>The best clue to understanding Ronald Reagan is Nancy Reagan. She is a graduate of Smith College in Massachusetts, a highly intelligent woman, an actress who met Ronald Reagan in Hollywood and married him in 1952. They were happily in love for more than fifty years. Nancy was also his closest friend, perhaps his only real friend, and she knew far more about him than anyone else in the world.<br><br>In 1989, just after they had left office, Nancy wrote a book about her life in which she told us more about Ronald Reagan than anyone. She knew the key to his self-assurance-he was a loner. Here is how she explained Reagan in her book:<br><br>It's hard to make close friends or to put down roots when you're always moving, and I think this-plus the fact that everybody knew his father was an alcoholic-explained why Ronnie became a loner. Although he loves people, he often seems remote, and he doesn't let anybody get too close.<br><br>There's a wall around him. He lets me come closer than anyone else, but there are times when even I feel that barrier.<br><br>Ronnie's closest friends and advisers have often been disappointed that he keeps this distance....<br><br>Ronnie is an affable and gregarious man who enjoys other people, but unlike most of us, he doesn't need them for companionship or approval.<br><br>As he himself has told me, he seems to need only one other person-me.<br><br>Despite all appearances, then, Reagan was a very private man. His pollster, Richard Wirthlin, met with him one day in March 1983, to give him the latest results. It was good news; the national polls were showing that Reagan's policies were widely supported. While he was reporting the polls, Reagan interrupted in midsentence and said:<br><br>You know what I really want to be remembered for?<br><br>I want to be remembered as the President of the United States who brought a sense and reality of peace and security. I want to eliminate that awful fear that each of us feels sometimes when we get up in the morning knowing that the world could be destroyed through a nuclear holocaust.<br><br>As far as we know he only said that once, in private. His usual answer about his legacy was a response about restoring the American economy.<br><br>Another foundation for Reagan's actions, perhaps, was his high intelligence-and his ability to hide it. He was an extraordinarily bright pupil who even taught himself how to read a newspaper when he was five years old. But as time went on, he seemed to quickly learn something that most highly intelligent people learn as they grow older: a child who seems to know all the answers soon has few friends. So he spent more time playing ball and being a regular student.<br><br>Unlike many intelligent people, Reagan's self-confidence was also great enough that he never felt he had to demonstrate his knowledge or his quickness. Indeed, on the front of his desk in the White House was a small sign that carried the words "There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit."<br><br>One of Reagan's key tactics while deep in long and arduous negotiations was to accept what his opponent had offered. He never crowed over what he was given; he just said thanks. As he explained it one day in Fortune magazine:<br><br>I've never understood people who want me to hang in there for a hundred percent or nothing. Why not take seventy percent or eighty percent, and then come back another day for the other twenty or thirty percent.<br><br>One of the few people who seemed to understand how Reagan managed the White House was Washington Post editor Meg Greenfield. In 1984 she wrote an essay for Newsweek titled "How Does Reagan Decide?" As a liberal Democrat, she observed something that even many of Reagan's closest conservative supporters failed to understand-that he made decisions like a labor negotiator for a workers' union. She summed up part of his decision-making style like this:<br><br>The long waiting out of the adversary, the immobility meanwhile, the refusal to give anything until the last moment, the willingness- nonetheless-finally to yield to superior pressure or force or particular circumstance on almost everything, but only with something to show in return, and only if the final deal can be interpreted as furthering the original Reagan objective.<br><br>Reagan was also an unusual boss. Those who worked for him liked him. They did not necessarily agree with all of his policies, but they still found him pleasant and friendly. He didn't criticize his advisers in front of others. He didn't chew people out. He didn't reprimand them, he didn't complain to them face-to-face-and he never yelled at them. Sometimes he might look a little disappointed when things went wrong, but you rarely felt a sense of failure or humiliation.<br><br>When people first met Reagan, they often thought he was too easygoing and friendly to be tough. The impression was like a soft down pillow. What people failed to see was the two-inch-thick rod of steel right down the inside of the pillow.<br><br>Perhaps the most important key to Reagan's success was the quality of his advisers and staff. Individually the men and women in his staff were very different, and they all had skills that matched the jobs they held. But the one thing they all shared was that they were all smart and sensible. Some presidents have felt uncomfortable with brilliant men and women; Reagan thrived on them.<br><br>Even his political opponents noted that the group of advisers and staff was unusual. Robert Strauss, perhaps the most savvy Democrat around when Reagan was elected, called Reagan's staff "simply spectacular. It's the best White House staff I've ever seen."<br><br>President Reagan's management philosophy was best summed up when a reporter asked: "Your friend Roger Smith, chairman of General Motors, says that you've done a great job of focusing on the big picture without getting bogged down in detail. How do you decide which problems to address personally, and which to leave to subordinates?" Reagan replied:<br><br>You surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don't interfere as long as the overall policy that you've decided upon is being carried out.<br><br>In the Cabinet meetings-and some members of the Cabinet who have been members of other Cabinets told me there have never been such meetings- I use a system in which I want to hear what everybody wants to say honestly. I want the decisions made on what is right or wrong, what is good or bad for the people of this country. I encourage all the input I can get....<br><br>And when I've heard all that I need to make a decision, I don't take a vote.<br><br>I make the decision.<br><br>Then I expect every one of them, whether their views have carried the day or not, to go forward together in carrying out the policy.<br><br>All this does not mean that Reagan was some kind of superhuman who could not be riled or upset. In fact, one of the most unappreciated facets of Reagan's character was his temper; it flared rarely, but was memorable when it did. If Reagan was crossed-crossed badly-he exploded into what could be called a black Irish rage. His face darkened, his jaw muscles clenched and bulged, and his lips got thin and tight. In public he might show sporadic flashes of displeasure, but never real anger. It wasn't that he did not get angry, but rather that he usually covered it up.<br><br>During his presidential campaign, on one of those rare occasions of real fury-a well-justified one, we might add-we watched him lean back a bit, reach up and grab the right side of his eyeglasses, rip the glasses off, and fling them across the room into the wall closest to him. After he smashed his glasses into the wall, he calmed down quickly and carried on. No one who was there can remember what happened to the eyeglasses. That kind of outburst didn't happen often- but it did happen.<br><br>Once during the campaign in 1976 Reagan was holding an impromptu press conference outside a building with a narrow alley. Some of the reporters were asking questions that had an insulting tone. After Reagan finished answering the last question, he turned and headed through the alley into the building, with the Secret Service clearing the way. When he was about halfway down the alley, one of the reporters, a particularly provocative one, yelled: "What's the matter? Are you afraid to answer the question?"<br><br>Reagan stopped, his face turning red. Abruptly he turned and headed back out through the alley. His eyes were blazing, focused on the heckler waiting outside. As he moved through the alley, one of the advisers was standing in the way. Reagan, with one swift thrust of his arm, shoved him aside, slamming him against the wall. Outside he angrily answered the reporter's question, then turned back and went into the building. (The fellow he "moved" was fine.)<br><br>Another rare example of what could make Reagan upset was a rewritten draft of one of his speeches. One day, Peter Hannaford, one of his oldest and most valued speechwriters, handed him a new redraft of a major speech for him to read on the plane. Reagan smiled, slipped on his reading glasses, and started to read. After two or three pages, his eyebrows narrowed and his jaw tightened. Then, after reading the next page, he lifted it, raised it high in the air, and slammed it down hard onto the small pile he had just read. He continued to read, slamming each succeeding page down harder and harder. It was clear he didn't like the redraft of the speech.<br><br>After Reagan had been in office for nearly six months, very few people understood his foreign policy. It especially bothered some of the reporters writing about him. They feared that he was on a course that could be dangerous, even leading the United States to a nuclear war. It was true that Reagan had never spelled out a detailed picture of what he wished to do in foreign policy, but it did not seem to bother him. A letter he dictated to a friend, John O. Koehl...</p><h2>The Cruellest Month</h2><p><p>"Many mystery buffs have credited Louise Penny with the revival of the type of traditional murder mystery made famous by Agatha Christie. . . .

Described as a "masterly study" and an "outstanding volume" on its first publication, <em>The Incas and Their Ancestors</em> quickly established itself as the best general introduction to the cultures and civilizations of ancient Peru.<br><br> Now this classic text has been fully updated for the revised edition. New discoveries over the last decade are integrated throughout. The occupation of Peru's desert coast can now be traced back to 12,000 BC and ensuing maritime adaptations are examined in early littoral societies that mummified their dead and others that were mound builders. The spread of Andean agriculture is related to fresh data on climate, and protracted drought is identified as a recurrent contributor to the rise and fall of civilizations in the Cordillera. The results of recent excavations enliven understanding of coastal Moche and Nazca societies and the ancient highland states of Huari and Tiwanaku.

He took a six-month journey across the so-called Asian Highway&#x2014;a swathe of Southeast Asia that, since the Victorian era, has seduced generations of tourists with its manufactured dreams of the exotic Orient. And like many a lost soul on this same route, he ended up in the harrowing forests of Papua, searching for a people who have never seen a tourist. &nbsp;What, Osborne asks, are millions of affluent itinerants looking for in these endless resorts, hotels, cosmetic-surgery packages, spas, spiritual retreats, sex clubs, and &#x201c;back to nature&#x201d; trips? What does tourism, the world&#x2019;s single largest business, have to sell? A travelogue into that heart of darkness known as the Western<br>mind, <i>The Naked Tourist </i>is the most mordant and ambitious work to date from the author of <i>The Accidental Connoisseu r</i>, praised by <i>The New York Times Book Review </i>as &#x201c;smart, generous, perceptive, funny, sensible.&#x201d;</p><p><b>LAWRENCE OSBORNE</b> has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and other publications, and is the author of four previous books.

It could be a disease of early middle age, a premature taste of senility: the need to leave the world as it is today behind and find somewhere else. You pack your belongings with a bitter fatalism, as if you know that it is now time to get moving again, to regress to nomadism. You pack your bags, but you have nowhere to go. It is like being dressed up for a ball long after the ballroom has burned down. The desire is there, but there is no object for it.<br>&nbsp;<br>I leafed through a hundred Web sites&#x2014;tour group organizations, government brochures, fact sheets, traveler accounts. But the problem of the modern traveler is that he has nowhere left to go. The entire world is a tourist installation, and the awful taste of simulacrum is continually in his mouth. I searched high and low, but nowhere satisfied the need to <i>leave the world</i>. I thought for a while of simply checking into a hotel in Hawaii and sitting there for two weeks in front of a television. Somewhere like the Hilton Waikoloa, perhaps, where I could laze on an artificial beach and take a monorail to the hotel nightclub. That would be more interesting than trekking with a small group through Patagonia or winging through the rain forest canopy of Costa Rica in a cable car. I could stay in New York and travel by subway to the forlorn Edgar Allan Poe house in the Bronx. No one goes <i>there</i>. There were exotic possibilities, but they were not very exotic&#x2014;and I wanted something exotic.<br>&nbsp;<br>Think back to the mood of childhood when you get into the family car and depart for places unknown&#x2014;how difficult it is to recover the inner dimension of <i>adventure</i>. Modern travel is like fast food: short, sharp incursions that do not weave a spell. In our age, tourism has made the planet into a uniform spectacle, and it has made us perpetual strangers wandering through an imitation of an imitation of a place we once wanted to go to. It is the law of diminishing returns.<br>&nbsp;<br>For a long time I had wanted to take leave of Planet Tourism, to find one of those places that occasionally turn up in the middle pages of newspapers in far-flung cities, in which&#x2014;we are told&#x2014;a mad loner has been discovered who has lost all contact with the modern world. It seems inevitable that this desire will one day be listed in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i> of the American Psychiatric Association as Robinson Crusoe Syndrome. But the stories are sometimes real. Recall the Japanese soldiers emerging out of Pacific jungles fifty years after their nation&#x2019;s surrender: what stupendous islands, we would like to know, had they been lost on? Once, flying around Indonesia, a journalist from Jakarta I was traveling with pointed down to the bewildering archipelagos of paradise isles below us, somewhere near Molucca, and said that he knew for a fact of a group of Germans who had sailed to one of them in 1967 and had never been seen since. All he knew was that a small local airline dropped them beer every few months. There were so many hundreds of islands that the wandering Teutons had simply disappeared. But I wanted to know <i>which</i> island they were on, if they existed at all. Because it&#x2019;s a potent idea, this promise of leaving the world, even if we know it&#x2019;s a myth.<br>* * *<br>Tourism is the world&#x2019;s largest industry, generating annual revenues of $500 billion. It defines the economies of scores of nations and cities across the globe. Between 1950 and 2002, the number of international travelers, including business travelers, rose from 25 million to 700 million a year: a sea change in the way the world conducts its affairs. The principal occupation of hundreds of millions of humans is now simply entertaining hundreds of millions of other humans. As for the rise of recreational travel, it is rising at all only because, one might presume, we are bored, because we want to have a transforming experience of some kind in a place other than home. We want a new experience&#x2014;and we want an experience that is commodified, that can be bought for cold cash, but that is safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tourism has also spawned many subsidiary professions. Not just agents, hoteliers, guides, and resort managers but also what are lugubriously known as &#x201c;travel writers.&#x201d; A technocratic culture loves to precede the noun &#x201c;writer&#x201d; with an adjective, thus assuring itself that the said individual is not a charlatan, that is, a loner with a voice, and that he is not&#x2014;horror of horrors&#x2014;just a writer. If you publish something only once about a foreign city, you instantly become a <i>travel writer</i>. Thus, I have often found myself called a travel writer, whatever that is, and consequently I have been induced occasionally to make a living at it. Sadly, this has led to a long collusion with the forces of global tourism, to long spells of aimless peregrination across entire continents, to 1,034 hotel rooms in 204 nations. Passing one&#x2019;s time in this way is a novel form of dementia. The hotels all look the same, because they are run by the same people; the places all look the same, because they are shaped by the same economic drives. Everywhere resembles everywhere else, and that is the way it has been designed. One day the whole world could easily be a giant interconnected resort called Wherever.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Marxist theorist Guy Debord once said, &#x201c;When the Spectacle is everywhere the spectator is nowhere at home.&#x201d; But at the same time, there comes a moment of revolution in the life of the pathetic travel writer, the man who travels to write and who writes to travel, when the world he has spent half a lifetime crisscrossing begins to taste like so much dead paper. He wants to leave and yet he cannot think how to do it. He wants to transcend being the tourist that he really is and become a true traveler again.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a way, I reached this point quite early on because I have no home and have not had one in decades. A nomad makes for a perfect tourist, but also for a perfectly disillusioned one. The travel writer in me began to decay almost as soon as he was born, but he did confer upon me the will and the means to construct a kind of grand tour for myself as a farewell to &#x201c;travel writing,&#x201d; in which I no longer have much faith. But how does one rediscover real travel?<br>&nbsp;<br>The word &#x201c;travel&#x201d; itself is surprisingly old. It dates back to 1375 and originally derived from the French verb <i>travailler</i>, &#x201c;to toil or labor,&#x201d; which in turn derived from the Latin word for a three-pronged stake used as an instrument of torture. Travel began, therefore, with the notion of doing something extremely nasty&#x2014;to go on a difficult journey. It&#x2019;s a medieval concept derived from pilgrimages. Suffering is implied, for to travel in the year 1375 was to suffer indeed. But it was seen as a transformative suffering, an escape from the boredom of daily life. Later, the notion of travel as an improving exercise emerged in the Grand Tour of the eighteenth century, as enjoyed by young British gents. The Grand Tour was entertaining, but it was not supposed to be. Nor did it entail venturing into the unknown. It was a cultural pilgrimage to the known world.<br>&nbsp;<br>But over the next two hundred years, a curiously wild and romantic conceit took hold of the Western itinerant. Once upon a time, there used to be two kinds of places: those you hadn&#x2019;t been to personally, and those that <i>nobody</i> had been to. Accordingly, there</p><h2>Telzey Amberdon</h2><p>Telzey Amberdon was only in her teens when she discovered that she was a telepath.

Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.</p></p><p><strong>Dr. Gary W.

A frequent contributor to <i>Archaeology, MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, Folklore, and the Journal of American Folklore</i>, she is often interviewed on NPR, the BBC, and on the History and Learning channels.This dense but highly informative volume narrates the long pretechnological history of the use of poisons and fire in warfare. Mayor, who has published in Military History Quarterly, begins with the first legend of poisoned arrows: Hercules and his quiver of missiles tipped with the hydra's venom (probably snake venom). He and his wife also figure in an early use of an externally applied poison-the "poisoned" garments that killed them both with an inextinguishable flame may have been impregnated with saltpeter. Using their powers of observation and a sound if rule-of-thumb grasp of cause and effect, our not-so-primitive ancestors went on to set fires, throw fires and project fires (Greek fire reached its apex when flung from a ship-mounted flame thrower). They also put poison on arrowheads, in food and wine and in water supplies, tamed elephants to use as living tanks, bottled scorpions to throw over walls and knew about the problems of accidental casualties, enemy retaliation and lowering the ethical level of warfare. Mayor clearly describes how some of the poisons caused gruesome deaths, and Greek fire was essentially napalm. One antielephant weapon consisted of coating live pigs with pitch, setting them on fire and driving them at the elephants. The sheer mass of information will be daunting for the novice, particularly to one not familiar with classical mythology, but the book is otherwise absolutely absorbing, if macabre, and a formidable source on classical warfare, with bibliography, illustrations and annotations to serve further research. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Enchantment (Arthurian Saga)</h2><p><p> Arthur Pendragon is King!

Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

His style is cartoonish, evoking childhood nostalgia and dereliction of adult responsibility. There is also a wealth of 1940s Columbia Records printed matter exhibiting Flora's visual pranks; 1950s RCA Victor-era work; magazine illustrations, sketchbooks, and prints; 1930s Little Man Press-era drawings; paintings from all decades; photos, and personal keepsakes. <br></p><p><p><strong>Irwin Chusid</strong>, based in Hoboken, NJ, is a journalist, music historian, radio personality and self-described &#x201c;landmark preservationist.&#x201d; Since 1975, Chusid has been a DJ on free-form radio station WFMU in New Jersey.

Then in 2005 the late commercial artist's family opened its stash--enough good stuff, Chusid imparts, for three more books. The first of those three draws primarily from what Chusid thinks is Flora's best period, the 1940s to the early 1960s, during which he put more wildness and violence into his work than he would allow in his later children's books and mainstream-magazine work. Since Flora's style is cartoonishly hieratic, there's nothing grim on view (well, maybe the Ben-Shahn-agit-propish "The Jealous Husband"); it's just that the pictures' extremely high spirits--whatever else they're doing, the figures in them seem to be jitterbugging--sometimes include a little mayhem. Besides more of Flora's Columbia Records, early magazine, and small-press work, this book includes 35 pages of previously unpublished sketches and completed pieces. Everything attests Flora's affinities to Picasso, Klee, Stuart Davis, the Mexican muralists, and especially Calder and Miro. <i>Real</i> smiley stuff. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We long for peace, for the ability to love and be loved openly and freely, and for the confidence and clarity to meet the various challenges we face in our daily lives.<br><br>Within each of us resides a spark of unparalleled brilliance, an unlimited capacity for warmth, openness, and courage, which Rinpoche identifies as &#x201c;essence love.&#x201d; Timeless and imperishable, essence love is often layered over by patterns of behavior and belief that urge us to seek happiness in conditions or situations that never quite live up to their promise. <br><br>Drawing on rarely discussed teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, Rinpoche describes how such patterns evolve and offers a series of meditation exercises to help us unravel them and, in the process, reawaken an energy and exuberance that can not only bring lasting fulfillment to our lives but ultimately serve to enliven and inspire the entire world, as well.<br><br>With great humor, intelligence, and candor, Tsoknyi Rinpoche also details his own struggles to reconnect with essence love.

But he&#x2019;s not alone. Lena Adams&#x2015;the county&#x2019;s sole female detective&#x2015;wants to see justice done, since her sister was the first victim. Sara, too, cannot escape the terror. A secret from her past could hold the key to finding the killer&#x2015;unless he finds her first.</p></p><p>In <i>Blindsighted</i> (book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to say, covered with blood from the get-go. <p> </p><blockquote> Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped. </blockquote><p> Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably, still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton. Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister. </p><p> And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound, from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend, to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.</p><p> A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse straight to the cliff-hanging denouement. And really, what more can you ask of an ME thriller? <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p><p>The killer strikes in plain sight . . . but you'll never see it coming.</p><p>The mutilation murder of a young college professor paralyzes a tiny Georgian community. This hideous crime is the worst thing small-town pediatrician and coroner Sara Linton has ever seen&#x2014;but only when the autopsy is complete is the intricate, terrible genius of a profoundly twisted psychopath truly revealed. As Sara's ex-husband&#x2014;Heartsdale police chief Jeffrey Tolliver&#x2014;pursues an elusive fiend, Lena Adams&#x2014;the victim's sister and the county's only female detective&#x2014;swears she'll have her personal vengeance. But their worst fears are realized by the macabre crucifixion of a second local woman: there is a serial slayer in their midst, one whose identity is hidden somewhere in Sara Linton's secret past. And this killer has no intention of stopping . . . and will not be stopped.</p></p><h2>Gloomy Gus (Old Edition)</h2><p>Because of an agreement his alcoholic father makes with a circus, 15-year-old Eric begins a long journey south from Alaska with the huge Kodiak bear he raised from a cub.</p><p></p><h2>The Giza Death Star Destroyed: The Ancient War for Future Science (Giza Death Star Trilogy)</h2><p>Recapitulates the function of the 10,000-year-old Giza military complex and recounts the final destruction of this gigantic machine - a machine that was destroyed by a great explosion within.</p><p>Joseph P.

With a poet&#x2019;s eye, she celebrates her daughter&#x2019;s acquisition of language and discoveries of the natural and human world around her. At the same time history shadows her steps everywhere she goes: from the San Francisco of settlers&#x2019; and investors&#x2019; dreams to the slave-trading ports of Ghana; from snow-white Maine to a festive, yet threatening, bonfire in the Virginia pinewoods.</p><p>With exceptional candor and grace, Dungy explores our inner and outer worlds&#x2015;the intimate and vulnerable experiences of raising a child, living with illness, conversing with strangers, and counting on others&#x2019; goodwill.

This is an earthier, more human Graham than in her own Blood Memory (p. 839); it is also a more detailed look at the era. Graham's vision was so focused that she was unaware of, or thought unimportant, the surroundings, players, intrigues; she was also extremely private. De Mille can and does give us the fuller picture. De Mille met Graham in the early Denishawn days in California; their lives and careers intertwined ever after with varying degrees of intensity. They were friends, worked with many of the same people, and kept a critical eye on each other's work. Graham's strength and will were apparent certainly by her teens; her genius was apparent early, too. De Mille follows the development of that gift, and along the way explores in depth Graham's contemporaries, technique, and the dance world generally. This is meaty, detailed stuff, and all in de Mille's wonderful voice. On Doris Humphrey: ``...she analyzed everything. It was not enough that a fall or lean could be lovely. She had to explain why...Her own dancing seemed to have little personality, while Martha's was electrifying.'' On the relationship between a choreographer's physique and his work, and Graham's in particular: she claimed that she always choregraphed falls on the left because the heart is on the left. ``Maybe so,'' says de Mille, ``but to this dancer it seems that it really was because her left leg and thigh were stronger and more stretched out.'' De Mille drops a number of bombshells here, particularly in her discussions of Graham's emotional life. She had stormy, sometimes physically abusive (by both parties) relationships in her life. De Mille describes the two most intense crises: Graham's failed marriage to Erick Hawkins; and her forced retirement as a dancer, in 1968, at age 72. This latter precipitated a physical collapse that de Mille names convincingly as being alcoholic. ``Martha got well, in her own way, in her own time, and without alcohol. Martha rose from the dead, and verily, she was changed now.'' A loving, respectful, but always cleareyed account of the human Graham. A must for fans of Graham's, de Mille's, dance- -indeed, anyone wanting a clear picture of a creative era that is fast drawing to a close.

Illustrated by artists from DC Comics. Mature readers.</p><p>Urban legends--those apocryphal, happened-to-a-friend-of-a-friend stories of such outlandish incidents as "the microwaved pet" and "alligators in the sewer"--are inherently fun, but they've never been as entertainingly presented as in this collection of some 200 told in comic strip format by a stunning variety of artists drawn from the comics mainstream (e.g., Howard Chaykin, Keith Giffen, Dick Giordano), underground (e.g., Tina Robbins, Justin Green, Shary Flenniken), and everywhere in between. Although the contributors' work is of uniformly high quality, some of them relate the tales in realistic, deadpan fashion, whereas others take a cartoony approach that exaggerates the already outlandish nature of the yarns. An introduction and commentary by urban folklore scholar and entrepreneur Jan Harold Brunvand (<i>The Vanishing Hitchhiker</i> [1981] et seq.) legitimizes the project, but as Brunvand points out, comics are just another manifestation of the same popular culture that spawned the legends in the first place. All told, the big paperback is a promising, affordable launching of DC Comics' new Paradox Press imprint. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Give Me A God I Can Relate To</h2><p>This is the first book by actress, poet, and feminist Blythe Baird.

Since fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging was introduced in the early 1990s, brain scans have been used to help politicians understand and manipulate voters, determine guilt in court cases, and make sense of everything from musical aptitude to romantic love. But although brain scans and other neurotechnologies have provided groundbreaking insights into the workings of the human brain, the increasingly fashionable idea that they are the most important means of answering the enduring mysteries of psychology is misguided and potentially dangerous.<br><br>In <i>Brainwashed</i>, psychiatrist and AEI scholar Sally Satel and psychologist Scott O. Lilienfeld reveal how many of the real-world applications of human neuroscience gloss over its limitations and intricacies, at times obscuring rather than clarifying the myriad factors that shape our behavior and identities. Brain scans, Satel and Lilienfeld show, are useful but often ambiguous representations of a highly complex system. Each region of the brain participates in a host of experiences and interacts with other regions, so seeing one area light up on an fMRI in response to a stimulus doesn't automatically indicate a particular sensation or capture the higher cognitive functions that come from those interactions. The narrow focus on the brain's physical processes also assumes that our subjective experiences can be explained away by biology alone. As Satel and Lilienfeld explain, this neurocentric&#x201d; view of the mind risks undermining our most deeply held ideas about selfhood, free will, and personal responsibility, putting us at risk of making harmful mistakes, whether in the courtroom, interrogation room, or addiction treatment clinic. <br><br>A provocative account of our obsession with neuroscience, <i>Brainwashed</i> brilliantly illuminates what contemporary neuroscience and brain imaging can and cannot tell us about ourselves, providing a much-needed reminder about the many factors that make us who we are.<br></p><p>Sally Satel is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a lecturer at Yale University School of Medicine, and a practicing psychiatrist. The author of <i>PC, M.D.</i>, she holds an MD from Brown University and completed her residency in psychiatry at Yale University. Satel lives in Washington, DC.<br><br>Scott O. Lilienfeld is a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at Emory University. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia<br><br><b>Andrew Solomon, author of <i>Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity</i></b><br> This thoughtful, provocative book provides a needed counterbalance to the arrogant neuromythology that purports to explain all of human behavior through brain imaging. It makes a strong moral argument that we are, ultimately, creatures of choice who can exercise will; it grapples boldly with a science that has sometimes threatened our understanding of what it is to be human.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Charles Murray, author of <i>Coming Apart</i></b><br> Science develops new tools that have promise for illuminating age-old questions, and those new tools are then misused or oversold until expectations are finally reconciled with reality. Sally Satel and Scott Lilienfield tell the story of neuroscience's real and illusory contribution to goals that range from treating addiction and detecting lies to mapping the neural underpinnings of morality. It is a daunting topic, but <i>Brainwashed</i> somehow manages to blend the authors' mastery of their subject with compulsive readability.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i><br> In their concise and well-researched book, [Satel and Lilienfeld] offer a reasonable and eloquent critique of this fashionable delusion, chiding the premature or unnecessary application of brain science to commerce, psychiatry, the law and ethics.... In a book that uses 'mindless' accusatively in the subtitle, you might expect an excitable series of attacks on purveyors of what's variously called neurohype, neurohubris and neurobollocks. But more often than not Dr. Satel and Mr. Lilienfeld stay fair and levelheaded. Good thing, because this is a topic that requires circumspection on all sides.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>New York Times</b></i><br> Dr. Satel and Dr. Lilienfeld offer a methodical critique of this oversimplified neuro-nonsense, convincingly arguing that in many ways the M.R.I.'s of today are simply the phrenology heads of yesteryear, laughably primitive attempts to wrangle human character and behavior into tractable form.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>PsycCRITIQUES</b></i><br> In this volume, these two prolific authors combine their talents to provocatively call for caution concerning many of the promises associated with neuroscience.... A very readable, even entertaining, commentary on how neuroscience is beginning to change the world....

Lilienfeld. Satel, a practising psychiatrist, and Lilienfeld, a clinical psychologist, are terrific sherpas. They are clear-sighted, considered and forgiving of the novice's ignorance&#x201d;<br><br><b>Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, and author of <i>How the Mind Works</i> and <i>The Stuff of Thought</i></b><br> Neuroscience is an exhilarating frontier of knowledge, but many of its champions have gotten carried away. This book shows how attempts to explain the human condition by pointing to crude blotches of brain activity may be superficially appealing but are ultimately unsatisfying. Sally Satel and Scott Lilienfeld are not dualists, romantics, mystics, or luddites. Their case for understanding the mind at multiple levels of analysis will resonate with thoughtful psychologists and biologists, and they make that case lucidly, expertly, and entertainingly. Anyone who is interested in the brain and who isn't? will be enlightened by this lively yet judicious critique.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Paul Bloom, Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science at Yale and author of <i>How Pleasure Works</i></b><br> In this smart, provocative and very accessible book, Satel and Lilienfeld are not out to bury neuroscience; they are here to save it to rescue it from those who have wildly exaggerated its practical and theoretical benefits. Some of this book is very funny, as when they review the dubious history of neuromarketing and neuropolitics, and some of it is dead serious, as in their discussion of how the abuse of neuroscience distorts criminal law and the treatment of addicts. <i>Brainwashed</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the use and abuse of one of the most important scientific developments of our time.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Hal Pashler, Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego</b><br> <i>Brainwashed</i> provides an engaging and wonderfully lucid tour of the many areas in which the progress and applications of neuroscience are currently being overstated and oversold. Some of the hyping of neuroscience appears fairly harmless, but more than a little of it carries potential for real damage especially when it promotes erroneous ideas about addiction and criminal behavior. The book combines clearheaded analysis with telling examples and anecdotes, making it a pleasure to read.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Jeffrey Rosen, Professor of Law, George Washington University and Legal Affairs Editor, <i>The New Republic</i></b><br> <i>Brainwashed</i> challenges the much-hyped claim that neuroscience will transform everything from marketing to the legal system to our ideas of blameworthiness and free will. Satel and Lilienfeld bring much needed skeptical intelligence to this field, giving neuroscience its due while recognizing its limitations. This is an invaluable contribution to one of our most contested debates about the ability of science to transform society.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Peter D.

She gives us the human drama behind some of the most celebrated works of the 20th century, from Richard Wright&#x2019;s <i>Native Son</i>, Simone de Beauvoir's <i>The Second Sex</i>, and James Baldwin's <i>Giovanni's Room</i> to Samuel Beckett's <i>Waiting for Godot </i>and Saul Bellow's <i>Augie March,</i> along with the origin stories of now legendary movements, from Existentialism to the Theatre of the Absurd, New Journalism, bebop, and French feminism.</p><p>We follow Arthur Koestler and Norman Mailer as young men, peek inside Picasso&#x2019;s studio, and trail the twists of Camus's, Sartre's, and Beauvoir&#x2019;s epic love stories. We witness the births and deaths of newspapers and literary journals and peer through keyholes to see the first kisses and last nights of many ill-advised bedfellows. At every turn, Poirier deftly hones in on the most compelling and colorful history, without undermining the crucial significance of the era. She brings to life the flawed, visionary Parisians who fell in love and out of it, who infuriated and inspired one another, all while reconfiguring the world's political, intellectual, and creative landscapes.</p><p>With its balance of clear-eyed historical narrative and irresistible anecdotal charm, <i>Left Bank</i> transports readers to a Paris teeming with passion, drama, and life.</p></p><p>Born in Paris,<b> Agnes Poirier</b> has lived and worked in London for the last twenty years, and writes in both English and French.

(Aramis has forsaken his musketeering ways, and Porthos...well, Porthos isn't around any more. Don't ask.) All this changes when one day the Martians attack Earth. Suddenly there is a need for swashes to be buckled, and Athos leaps back into the fray with a vengeance. Robots, evil alien emperors, beautiful alien princesses, rayguns vs. swords, treachery, secret corridors, insanely cool-looking robots...<em>The Last Musketeer</em> is vintage sci-fi adventure with a unique twist from an internationally acclaimed cartoonist.<br></p><p>Jason hails from Oslo, Norway, but currently resides in Montpellier, France. He&#39;s won multiple Eisners, a Harvey, and an Inkpot award.Having already plundered Hitchcockian wrong-man scenarios (<i>Why Are You Doing This?</i>), zombie flicks (<i>The Living and the Dead</i>) and alternate history paradoxes (<i>I Killed Adolf Hitler</i>) for his own sardonic purposes, Jason goes this time for a multigenre mash-up that proves to be one of his most enjoyable books yet. In <i>The Last Musketeer</i>, Athos is still alive in modern-day Paris, a drunken has-been unable to let go of past glories. He proves surprisingly handy, though, at defending Earth after overpowering a couple of invading Martians, hitching a ride back to their planet and taking on the alien army singlehandedly. Swordplay, dungeons, a princess, ray guns and daring escapes follow, all drawn with Jason's usual sharp and colorful vibrancy. In the hands of most other comic artists, mixing up this goofy Dumas riff with Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x2013;style pulp (and caped costumes right out of <i>Flash Gordon</i>) would have seemed like desperation, overreaching or mockery. But as done by the supremely confident Jason&#x2014;who has always paired a cool abstraction with a sharp comic streak&#x2014;it comes off as a genuinely appreciative lark, albeit one veined with a rare sense of mortality. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But according to Peter Huber and Mark Mills, the things we "know" are mostly myths. In <i>The Bottomless Well</i> , Huber and Mills debunk the myths and show how a better understanding of energy will radically change our views and policies on a number of very controversial issues. They explain why demand will never go down, why most of what we think of as "energy waste" actually benefits us; why greater efficiency will never lead to energy conservation; and why the energy supply is infinite-it's quality of energy that's scarce and expensive. <i>The Bottomless Well</i> will also revolutionize our thinking about the automotive industry (gas prices don't matter and the hybrid engine is irrelevant), coal and uranium, the much-maligned power grid (it's the worst system we could have except for all the others), what energy supplies mean for jobs and GDP, and many other hotly debated subjects.</p><p>&#34;It is a tribute to Huber and Mills that they succeed in explaining the importance of entropy in a book that is entertaining, fascinating, informative and even visionary.&#34; (Richard S.

Marion, wife of Peter Carpenter, has had a life marked by tragedy--most importantly, the deaths of several children, one of whom she still most especially mourns. She has also enjoyed some relative good fortune, with a generally reliable husband and, as the miller's daughter, automatic respect in the community. As the year passes, Marion is principally occupied with preparing for the winter ahead and tending to her children. She worries about the future of her lame son Peterkin, who will never be able to do an adult man's work, and she is pleased, if bemused, by the rapid development of her gifted young daughter Alice. Marion's year is filled with chores--baking, spinning, gardening--and with routine hardships--dealing with cold, hunger, illness, and pain. Meanwhile, some change occurs: Marion's sickly daughter Margery dies; a friend's husband, whom Marion once loved herself, falls victim to an infection; M'Dame, wife of the feudal lord, becomes pregnant; Peter acquires new authority after participating in a successful expedition to get salt; and a neighboring family descends into squalor. But as Marion goes about her day-to-day activities- -figuring out how to put out a fire when her only pails are full of milk, wondering what she really looks like when she has seen her reflection only in pools, mediating Peter's anger at his son's carelessness, or enjoying a rare good night's sleep--her greatest concerns are immediate, practical, and intimately related to the circumstances of time and place. The need to turn Marion into Everywoman sometimes puts an undue burden on the novel, but, still, Baer has crafted a persuasive and scrupulously detailed account, locating the universal in the specifics of one modest life. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

If the South lost the West, there would be little hope of preserving the Confederacy. Earl J. Hess's comprehensive study of how Federal forces conquered and held the West examines the geographical difficulties of conducting campaigns in a vast land, as well as the toll irregular warfare took on soldiers and civilians alike. Hess balances a thorough knowledge of the battle lines with a deep understanding of what was happening within the occupied territories.<br>In addition to a mastery of logistics, Union victory hinged on making use of black manpower and developing policies for controlling constant unrest while winning campaigns. Effective use of technology, superior resource management, and an aggressive confidence went hand in hand with Federal success on the battlefield. In the end, Confederates did not have the manpower, supplies, transportation potential, or leadership to counter Union initiatives in this critical arena.<br><br></p><p>"No historian is better equipped than Earl Hess to tell the important story of the Civil War in the West and none does a better job of explaining why it was important and how it decided the outcome of the broader conflict."--Steven E.

Surveying this turbulent history, Paul Mason wonders whether today we are on the brink of a change so big, so profound, that this time capitalism itself, the immensely complex system by which entire societies function, has reached its limits and is changing into something wholly new.</p><p>At the heart of this change is information technology: a revolution that, as Mason shows, has the potential to reshape utterly our familiar notions of work, production and value; and to destroy an economy based on markets and private ownership - in fact, he contends, it is already doing so. </p><p>In this groundbreaking, <i>Sunday Times</i> top ten book, Mason shows how, from the ashes of the recent financial crisis, we have the chance to create a more socially just and sustainable global economy.</p></p><p><b>Paul Mason</b> was the award-winning economics editor of Channel 4 News.

She&#39;s just as feisty and terrifying and goodhearted as she was in Richard Peck&#39;s A Long Way from Chicago, and every bit as funny. In the first book, a Newbery Honor winner, Grandma&#39;s rampages were seen through the eyes of her grandson Joey, who, with his sister, Mary Alice, was sent down from Chicago for a week every summer to visit. But now it&#39;s 1937 and Joey has gone off to work for the Civilian Conservation Corps, while 15-year-old Mary Alice has to go stay with Grandma alone--for a whole year, maybe longer. From the very first moment when she arrives at the depot clutching her Philco portable radio and her cat, Bootsie, Mary Alice knows it won&#39;t be easy. And it&#39;s not. She has to sleep alone in the attic, attend a hick town school where in spite of her worn-out coat she&#39;s &#34;the rich girl from Chicago,&#34; and be an accomplice in Grandma&#39;s outrageous schemes to run the town her own way--and do good while nobody&#39;s looking. But being Grandma&#39;s sidekick is always interesting, and by the end of the year, Mary Alice has grown to see the formidable love in the heart of her formidable Grandma. Peck is at his best with these hilarious stories that rest solidly within the American literary tradition of Mark Twain and Bret Harte. Teachers will cherish them as great read-alouds, and older teens will gain historical perspective from this lively picture of the depression years in small-town America.

Doron Swade, technology historian and assistant director of London's Science Museum, investigates the troubles that plagued 19th-century knowledge engineers in <i>The Difference Engine: Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer</i>.<p>The author is in a unique position to appreciate the technical difficulties of the time, as he led a team that built a working model of a Difference Engine, using contemporary materials, in time for Babbage's 1991 bicentenary. The meat of the book is comprised of the story of the first computing machine design as gathered from the technical notes and drawings curated by Swade. Though Babbage certainly had problems translating his ideas into brass, the reader also comes to understand his fruitless, drawn-out arguments with his funders. Swade had it comparatively easy, though his depictions of the frustrating search for money and then working out how best to build the enormous machine in the late 1980s are delightful.</p><p>It is difficult--maybe impossible--to draw a clear, unbroken line of influence from Babbage to any modern computer researchers, but his importance both as the first pioneer and as a symbol of the joys and sorrows of computing is unquestioned. Swade clearly respects his subject deeply, all the more so for having tried to bring the great old man's ideas to life. <i>The Difference Engine</i> is lovingly comprehensive and will thrill readers looking for a more technical examination of Babbage's career. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Doron Swade is Assistant Director and Head of Collections at the Science Museum in London.</p><h2>The Big Show: Charles M.

He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.<b>JERUSALEM'S LOT</b><br><br>Oct. 2, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>How good it was to step into the cold, draughty hall here at Chapelwaite, every bone in an ache from that abominable coach, in need of instant relief from my distended bladder&#x2014;and to see a letter addressed in your own inimitable scrawl propped on the obscene little cherry-wood table beside the door! Be assured that I set to deciphering it as soon as the needs of the body were attended to (in a coldly ornate downstairs bathroom where I could see my breath rising before my eyes).<br><br>I'm glad to hear that you are recovered from the <i>miasma</i> that has so long set in your lungs, although I assure you that I do sympathize with the moral dilemma the cure has affected you with. An ailing abolitionist healed by the sunny climes of slave-struck Florida! Still and all, Bones, I ask you as a friend who has also walked in the valley of the shadow, <i>to take all care of yourself </i>and venture not back to Massachusetts until your body gives you leave. Your fine mind and incisive pen cannot serve us if you are clay, and if the Southern zone is a healing one, is there not poetic justice in that?<br><br>Yes, the house is quite as fine as I had been led to believe by my cousin's executors, but rather more sinister. It sits atop a huge and jutting point of land perhaps three miles north of Falmouth and nine miles north of Portland. Behind it are some four acres of grounds, gone back to the wild in the most formidable manner imaginable&#x2014;junipers, scrub vines, bushes, and various forms of creeper climb wildly over the picturesque stone walls that separate the estate from the town domain. Awful imitations of Greek statuary peer blindly through the wrack from atop various hillocks&#x2014;they seem, in most cases, about to lunge at the passer-by. My cousin Stephen's tastes seem to have run the gamut from the unacceptable to the downright horrific. There is an odd little summer house which has been nearly buried in scarlet sumac and a grotesque sundial in the midst of what must once have been a garden. It adds the final lunatic touch.<br><br>But the view from the parlour more than excuses this; I command a dizzying view of the rocks at the foot of Chapelwaite Head and the Atlantic itself. A huge, bellied bay window looks out on this, and a huge, toadlike secretary stands beside it. It will do nicely for the start of that novel which I have talked of so long [and no doubt tiresomely].<br><br>To-day has been gray with occasional splatters of rain. As I look out all seems to be a study in slate&#x2014;the rocks, old and worn as Time itself, the sky, and of course the sea, which crashes against the granite fangs below with a sound which is not precisely sound but vibration&#x2014;I can feel the waves with my feet even as I write. The sensation is not a wholly unpleasant one.<br><br>I know you disapprove my solitary habits, dear Bones, but I assure you that I am fine and happy. Calvin is with me, as practical, silent, and as dependable as ever, and by midweek I am sure that between the two of us we shall have straightened our affairs and made arrangement for necessary deliveries from town&#x2014;and a company of cleaning women to begin blowing the dust from this place!<br><br>I will close&#x2014;there are so many things as yet to be seen, rooms to explore, and doubtless a thousand pieces of execrable furniture to be viewed by these tender eyes. Once again, my thanks for the touch of familiar brought by your letter, and for your continuing regard.<br><br>Give my love to your wife, as you both have mine.<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 6, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>Such a place this is!<br><br>It continues to amaze me&#x2014;as do the reactions of the townfolk in the closest village to my occupancy. That is a queer little place with the picturesque name of Preacher's Corners. It was there that Calvin contracted for the weekly provisions. The other errand, that of securing a sufficient supply of cordwood for the winter, was likewise taken care of. But Cal returned with gloomy countenance, and when I asked him what the trouble was, he replied grimly enough:<br><br>"They think you mad, Mr. Boone!"<br><br>I laughed and said that perhaps they had heard of the brain fever I suffered after my Sarah died&#x2014;certainly I spoke madly enough at that time, as you could attest.<br><br>But Cal protested that no-one knew anything of me except through my cousin Stephen, who contracted for the same services as I have now made provision for. "What was said, sir, was that anyone who would live in Chapelwaite must be either a lunatic or run the risk of becoming one."<br><br>This left me utterly perplexed, as you may imagine, and I asked who had given him this amazing communication. He told me that he had been referred to a sullen and rather besotted pulp-logger named Thompson, who owns four hundred acres of pine, birch, and spruce, and who logs it with the help of his five sons, for sale to the mills in Portland and to householders in the immediate area.<br><br>When Cal, all unknowing of his queer prejudice, gave him the location to which the wood was to be brought, this Thompson stared at him with his mouth ajaw and said that he would send his sons with the wood, in the good light of the day, and by the sea road.<br><br>Calvin, apparently misreading my bemusement for distress, hastened to say that the man reeked of cheap whiskey and that he had then lapsed into some kind of nonsense about a deserted village and cousin Stephen's relations&#x2014;and worms! Calvin finished his business with one of Thompson's boys, who, I take it, was rather surly and none too sober or freshly-scented himself. I take it there has been some of this reaction in Preacher's Corners itself, at the general store where Cal spoke with the shop-keeper, although this was more of the gossipy, behind-the-hand type.<br><br>None of this has bothered me much; we know how rustics dearly love to enrich their lives with the smell of scandal and myth, and I suppose poor Stephen and his side of the family are fair game. As I told Cal, a man who has fallen to his death almost from his own front porch is more than likely to stir talk.<br><br>The house itself is a constant amazement. Twenty-three rooms, Bones! The wainscotting which panels the upper floors and the portrait gallery is mildewed but still stout. While I stood in my late cousin's upstairs bedroom I could hear the rats scuttering behind it, and big ones they must be, from the sound they make&#x2014;almost like people walking there. I should hate to encounter one in the dark; or even in the light, for that matter. Still, I have noted neither holes nor droppings. Odd.<br><br>The upper gallery is lined with bad portraits in frames which must be worth a fortune. Some bear a resemblance to Stephen as I remember him. I believe I have correctly identified my Uncle Henry Boone and his wife Judith; the others are unfamiliar. I suppose one of them may be my own notorious grandfather, Robert. But Stephen's side of the family is all but unknown to me, for which I am heartily sorry. The same good humour that shone in Stephen's letters to Sarah and me, the same light of high intellect, shines in these portraits, bad as they are. For what foolish reasons families fall out! A rifled <i>escritoire</i>, hard words between brothers now dead three generations, and blameless descendants are needlessly estranged. I cannot help reflecting upon how fortunate it was that you and John Petty succeeded in contacting Stephen when it seemed I might follow my Sarah through the Gates&#x2014;and upon how unfortunate it was that chance should have robbed us of a face-to-face meeting. How I would have loved to hear him defend the ancestral statuary and furnishings!<br><br>But do not let me denigrate the place to an extreme. Stephen's taste was not my own, true, but beneath the veneer of his additions there are pieces [a number of them shrouded by dust-covers in the upper chambers] which are true masterworks. There are beds, tables, and heavy, dark scrollings done in teak and mahogany, and many of the bedrooms and receiving chambers, the upper study and small parlour, hold a somber charm. The floors are rich pine that glow with an inner and secret light. There is dignity here; dignity and the weight of years. I cannot yet say I like it, but I do respect it. I am eager to watch it change as we revolve through the changes of this northern clime.<br><br>Lord, I run on! Write soon, Bones. Tell me what progress you make, and what news you hear from Petty and the rest. And please do not make the mistake of trying to persuade any new Southern acquaintances as to your views <i>too forcibly</i>&#x2014;I understand that not all are content to answer merely with their mouths, as is our long-winded <i>friend</i>, Mr. Calhoun.<br><br>Yr. affectionate friend,<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 16, 1850.<br><br>DEAR RICHARD,<br><br>Hello, and how are you? I have thought about you often since I have taken up residence here at Chapelwaite, and had half-expected to hear from you&#x2014;and now I receive a letter from Bones telling me that I'd forgotten to leave my address at the club! Rest assured that I would have written eventually anyway, as it sometimes seems that my true and loyal friends are all I have left in the world that is sure and completely normal. And, Lord, how spread we've become! You in Boston, writing faithfully for <i>The Liberator</i> [to which I have also sent my address, incidentally], Hanson in England on another of his confounded<i> jaunts</i>, and poor old Bones in the very <i>lions' lair</i>, recovering his lungs.<br><br>It goes as well as can be expected here, Dick, and be assured I will render you a full account when I am not quite as pressed by certain events which are extant here&#x2014;I think your legal mind may be quite intrigued by certain happenings at Chapelwaite and in the area about it.<br><br>But in the meantime I have a favour to ask, if you will entertain it. Do you remember the historian you introduced me to at Mr. Clary's fund-raising dinner for the cause? I believe his name was Bigelow. At any rate, he mentioned that he made a hobby of collecting odd bits of historical lore which pertained to the very area in which I am now living. My favour, then, is this: Would you contact him and ask him what facts, bits of folklore, or <i>general rumour</i>&#x2014;if any&#x2014;he may be conversant with about a small, deserted village called JERUSALEM'S LOT, near a township called Preacher's Corners, on the Royal River? The stream itself is a tributary of the Androscoggin, and flows into that river approximately eleven miles above that river's emptying place near Chapelwaite. It would gratify me intensely, and, more important, may be a matter of some moment.<br><br>In looking over this letter I feel I have been a bit short with you, Dick, for which I am heartily sorry. But be assured I will explain myself shortly, and until that time I send my warmest regards to your wife, two fine sons, and, of course, to yourself.<br><br>Yr. affectionate friend,<br><br>CHARLES.<br>Oct. 16, 1850.<br><br>DEAR BONES,<br><br>I have a tale to tell you which seems a little strange [and even disquieting] to both Cal and me&#x2014;see what you think. If nothing else, it may serve to amuse you while you battle the mosquitoes!<br><br>Two days after I mailed my last to you, a group of four young ladies arrived from the Corners under the supervision of an elderly lady of intimidatingly-competent visage named Mrs. Cloris, to set the place in order and to remove some of the dust that had been causing me to sneeze seemingly at every other step. They all seemed a little nervous as they went about their chores; indeed, one flighty miss uttered a small screech when I entered the upstairs parlour as she dusted.<br><br>I asked Mrs. Cloris about this [she was dusting the downstairs hall with grim determination that would have quite amazed you, her hair done up in an old faded bandanna], and she turned to me and said with an air of determination: "They don't like the house, and I don't like the house, sir, because it has always been a <i>bad</i> house."<br><br>My jaw dropped at this unexpected bit, and she went on in a kindlier tone: "I do not mean to say that Stephen Boone was not a fine man, for he was; I cleaned for him every second Thursday all the time he was here, as I cleaned for his father, Mr. Randolph Boone, until he and his wife disappeared in eighteen and sixteen. Mr. Stephen was a good and kindly man, and so you seem, sir (if you will pardon my bluntness; I know no other way to speak), but the house is <i>bad</i> and it always <i>has been</i>, and no Boone has ever been happy here since your grandfather Robert and his brother Philip fell out over stolen [and here she paused, almost guiltily] items in seventeen and eighty-nine."<br><br>Such memories these folks have, Bones!<br><br>Mrs. Cloris continued: "The house was built in unhappiness, has been lived in with unhappiness, there has been blood spilt on its floors [as you may or may not know, Bones, my Uncle Randolph was involved in an accident on the cellar stairs which took the life of his daughter Marcella; he then took his own life in a fit of remorse. The incident is related in one of Stephen's letters to me, on the sad occasion of his dead sister's birthday], there has been disappearance and accident.<br><br>"I have worked here, Mr. Boone, and I am neither blind nor deaf. I've heard awful sounds in the walls, sir, awful sounds&#x2014;thumpings and crashings and once a strange wailing that was half-laughter. It fair made my blood curdle. It's a dark place, sir." And there she halted, perhaps afraid she had spoken too much.<br><br>As for myself, I hardly knew whether to be offended or amused, curious or merely matter-of-fact. I'm afraid that amusement won the day. "And what do you suspect, Mrs. Cloris? Ghosts rattling chains?"<br><br>But she only looked at me oddly. "Ghosts there may be. But it's not ghosts in the walls. It's not ghosts that wail and blubber like the damned and crash and blunder away in the darkness. It's&#x2014;"<br><br>"Come, Mrs. Cloris," I prompted her. "You've come this far. Now can you finish what you've begun?"<br><br>The strangest expression of terror, pique, and-I would swear to it&#x2014;religious awe passed over her face. "Some die not," she whispered. "Some live in the twilight shadows Between to serve&#x2014;Him!"</p><h2>Mad Men Carousel: The Complete Critical Companion</h2><p><i>Mad Men Carousel</i> is an episode-by-episode guide to all seven seasons of AMC's&nbsp;<i>Mad Men</i>. <b>This book collects TV and movie critic Matt Zoller Seitz&#x2019;s celebrated <i>Mad Men</i> recaps</b>&#x2014;as featured on&nbsp;<i>New York&nbsp;</i>magazine's&nbsp;<i>Vulture&nbsp;</i>blog&#x2014;for the first time, including<b> never-before-published essays </b>on the show&#x2019;s first three seasons.

Tracing the abducted girl deep into the forest, Usagi finds it haunted by creatures of Japanese legend and discovers that they are amassing for a great raid on the countryside! Fortunately, Usagi is joined by Sasuke the Demon Queller, who is also fighting to prevent the invasion, but things aren&#39;t always as they seem, especially when dealing with the supernatural!</p><p>Simplicity has long been the hallmark of Sakai&#x2019;s stories of a wandering rabbit samurai and his various trials throughout a flawlessly researched historical Japan. To help celebrate the comic-book series&#x2019; twenty-fifth year comes its first original graphic novel (and, unusually, in full color, too). The tale is a simple one: Usagi follows a tricky fox spirit into a demon-infested wood at the behest of a mother who has lost her child therein. Whereas Sakai&#x2019;s narrative minimalism is deceptive over the course of the series&#x2014;small events and intrigues form a much larger tapestry that produces an epic sweep&#x2014;in this stand-alone tale, the simplicity makes for a story that is essentially one large fight scene. It&#x2019;s a cool fight scene, to be sure, with the dogged samurai taking on a phantasmagoria of weird spirits and demons lifted from Japanese folklore and meeting up with an ancient demon hunter who holds the key to the story&#x2019;s somewhat predictable twist.

It&#39;s January 1st and Brian Bilston is convinced that this year, his New Year&#39;s resolution will change his life. Every day for a year, he will write a poem. It&#39;s quite simple. Brian&#39;s life certainly needs improving. His ex-wife has taken up with a new man, he seems to constantly disappoint his long-suffering son, and at work he is drowning in a sea of spreadsheets and management jargon. So poetry will be his salvation. But there is an obstacle in the form of Toby Salt, his arch nemesis at Poetry Club and rival suitor to Liz, Brian&#39;s new poetic inspiration. When Toby goes missing, just after the announcement of the publication of his first collection, This Bridge No Hands Shall Cleave , Brian becomes the number one suspect.

Reprint. K.</p><p>Using the same Florida setting as his horror novel Shade of the Tree , Anthony here conjures up a nightmarish creature who stalks humans through sexual attraction and leaves them grotesquely sucked dry of their protoplasm. When bodies reduced to skin and skeleton are found on a remote wildlife sanctuary, the reclusive owner of the estate refuses to call in outside help to track down the killer. His employees are left to fend for themselves against the menace of a predator who lures them in the way a firefly traps its prey--by emitting pheromones, powerfully sexual chemicals--and uses digestive acids to dissolve the bodies of its victims. Speculating about the power of an alien monster to decimate the human race, Anthony devotes much of the narrative to plumbing his characters' past experiences, many of them couched in allegorical terms, and examining the differences between love and sex, with emphasis on sexual abuse. Absorbed in working out his theme, Anthony unfortunately overlooks flawed logic and plot inconsistencies. While some readers may find his ideas intriguing, many will be put off by a narrative that verges on the pornographic. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.A mysterious monster stalks a private wildlife preserve, leaving behind only the skin and bones of its victims--and an overpowering pheromonic residue.

A compelling, readable, occasionally funny work, it vividly illuminates the life of the ghetto, not just the despair and the violence, but the pride and the vitality as well.</p><p>For Francie, childhood in 1930s Harlem means having one brother in the gangs and another who gives up his dream of being a chemist because "how many firms gonna hire a black chemist?" It's having a big, beautiful father who can't find legal work and a mother who defies her husband and hires out as domestic labor in order to keep the family from starving. Childhood for Francie is having household chores like attaching the jumper to get free electricity and facing the disdain of Mrs. Burnett when she buys groceries from her on credit. It's avoiding the groping hands of the butcher, the baker and the fat little white man who sits next to her in the theater, or maybe not avoiding them for the extra meat, rolls, or dime they might offer. It means reading "smutty" comic books and walking down 118th street where the prostitutes work, but not knowing what is happening when her period starts. Francie's Harlem is a powerful, pent-up place, where dreams and good people are changed and destroyed, a neighborhood with strength and beauty, love and friendship, all trying to grow like plants without soil or water. And for Francie, during the year she turns from twelve to thirteen, living in Harlem means exchanging her longing for the white-hatted cowboy in the movies for a feeling of kinship with the Indians and a realization of what it means to be black and female in the United States. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Ulysses Voyage</h2><p>Attempts to recreate the voyage of Ulysses and identify the likely position of places mentioned in Homer&#39;s account of his adventures</p><p></p><h2>Making Star Trek</h2><p>Traces the history and production of the multimillion-dollar motion picture &#34;Star Trek.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>My Stubborn Heart</h2><p>A Sensational CBA Debut in Contemporary Romance! &nbsp;This summer author Becky Wade makes her CBA debut with a fun -- and funny -- contemporary romance. &nbsp;Amidst the light-hearted banter and laugh-out-loud moments is a compelling spiritual journey of one woman's choice to listen to God and wait on him. &nbsp;Filled with humor and authentic romance, My Stubborn Heart is shaping up to be the hit of the summer.<br><br>Kate Donovan is burned out on work, worn down by her dating relationships, and in need of an adventure.

But, fortunately, Tom Wolfe was there, notebook in hand, politely declining LSD while Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters fomented revolution, turning America on to a dangerously playful way of thinking as their Day-Glo conveyance, Further, made the most influential bus ride since Rosa Parks's. By taking <i>On the Road</i>'s hero Neal Cassady as his driver on the cross-country revival tour and drawing on his own training as a magician, Kesey made Further into a bully pulpit, and linked the beat epoch with hippiedom. Paul McCartney's <i>Many Years from Now</i> cites Kesey as a key influence on his trippy <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> film. Kesey temporarily renounced his literary magic for the cause of "tootling the multitudes"--making a spectacle of himself--and Prankster Robert Stone had to flee Kesey's wild party to get his life's work done. But in those years, Kesey's life <i>was</i> his work, and Wolfe infinitely multiplied the multitudes who got tootled by writing this major literary-journalistic monument to a resonant pop-culture moment. <p> Kesey's theatrical metamorphosis from the distinguished author of <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> to the abominable shaman of the "Acid Test" soirees that launched The Grateful Dead required Wolfe's Day-Glo prose account to endure (though Kesey's own musings in <i>Demon Box</i> are no slouch either). Even now, Wolfe's book gives what Wolfe clearly got from Kesey: a contact high. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"<i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> is not simply the best book on the hippies, it is the book...the pushing, ballooning heart of the matter...Vibrating dazzle!"<br>--Eliot Fremont-Smith, <i>The New York Times</i><p>"Among journalists, Wolfe is a geniune poet; what makes him so good is his ability to get inside, to not merely describe (although he is a superb reporter), but to get under the skin of a phenomenon and transmit its metabolic rhythm."<br><i>--Newsweek</i></p><p>"<i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> is an amazing book...A book that definitely gives Wolfe the edge on the non-fiction novel."<br><i>--Village Voice</i></p><p>"A Day-Glo book; illuminating, merry, surreal!"<br><i>--The Washington Post</i></p><p>"Some consider Mailer our greatest journalist; my candidate is Wolfe."<br>--Studs Terkel, <i>BookWeek</i></p><p>"Tom Wolfe is a groove and a gas. Everyone should send him money and other fine things.

From the moment Sister John and Sister Hyacinthe reach the old house left to their abbey by a mysterious benefactor, their cloistered world begins to crumble. First, there is the wounded man hiding in the house, then the suitcase stuffed with money sitting at the bottom of the well, not to mention fearful apparitions in the night. Lord only knows what&#39;s going on. That is, until the good sisters, armed only with their faith and boundless energy, set things right--even if it means a shocking revelation or two about ghosts, gangsters...and murder.</p><p><b>Dorothy Gilman</b>&nbsp;(1923&#x2013;2012) was the author of 14 Mrs. Pollifax novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax,&nbsp;</i>the series debut;&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Pollifax Pursued;</i>&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Pollifax and the Lion Killer;</i>&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Pollifax, Innocent Tourist;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Pollifax Unveiled</i>. She was also the author of many other novels, among them&nbsp;<i>Thale&#x2019;s Folly</i>.</p><h2>Backlands: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>In this Bonnie and Clyde story of love and betrayal, a band of outlaws fight for control of the brutal Brazilian outback.</strong></p><p>Set in the sparse frontier settlements of northeastern Brazil&#x2015;a dry, forbidding, and wild region the size of Texas, known locally as <em>the Sertao</em>&#x2015;<em>Backlands</em> tells the true story of a group of nomadic outlaws who reigned over the area from about 1922 until 1938. Taking from the rich, admired&#x2015;and feared&#x2015;by the poor, they were led by the famously charismatic bandit Lampiao. The gang maintained their influence by fighting off all the police and soldiers the region could muster.</p><p>A one-eyed goat rancher who first set out to avenge his father's murder in a lawless land, Lampiao proved to be too good a leader, fighter, and strategist to ever return home again. By 1925 he commanded the biggest gang of outlaws in Brazil. Known to this day as a "prince," Lampiao had everything: brains, money, power, charisma, and luck.&nbsp;Everything but love, until he met Maria Bonita.</p><p>"You teach me to make lace, and I'll teach you to make love"&#x2015;this was the song the bandits marched to, across the vast open reaches of their starkly beautiful backlands, and it was Maria Bonita who made it come true. She was stuck in a loveless marriage when she met Lampiao, but she rode off with him, becoming "Queen of the Bandits." Together the couple&#x2015;still celebrated folk heroes&#x2015;would become the country's most wanted figures, protecting their extraordinary freedom through cunning.</p><p>Victoria Shorr's stunning literary debut tells Maria's story, her narrative of the intense freedoms, terrors, and sorrows of this chosen life, the end of which is clear to her all along. With the federal government in Rio mobilizing against the bandits, <em>Backlands</em> describes the epic final days of Lampiao&#x2019;s "fatal month," July on the River of Disorder, as the gang struggles to summon their good star to save them one more time.</p></p><p>Victoria Shorr&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;Backlands, was named one of Booklist&#x2019;s top-ten first novels of 2015. She cofounded the Archer School for Girls in California and the Pine Ridge Girls&#x2019; School in South Dakota, the first independent, culturally based, college-prep school for girls on a Native reservation in America. She lives in Pacific Palisades, California.&#x201c;Shorr astutely and lyrically illuminates the mythological, psychological, and social dimensions of the bandit lovers&#x2019; lives, portraying them both as poignantly complex and besieged individuals and archetypal warriors ardently defending wildness in all its embodiments.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist, Starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tender, almost languid, but deeply satisfyingly paced, <em>Backlands</em> is less a tale of adventure than an exploration of love and loyalty, of the relationship between a people and their land.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrea Wulf, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A poignant meditation on life, love, loyalty, and death in an unforgiving land.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An exciting, extraordinary tale of a legendary Brazilian outlaw and his woman (the Robin Hood and Maid Marian of the badlands) told in a style as dashing and vivid as the romantic myth that surrounds them. Victoria Shorr writes with droll, lyrical, pithy precision as well as a sure sense of the deep mystery of her characters and the exotic landscape they inhabit.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Lahr, author of <em>Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Shorr has really found the voice to tell the story.

He retains a British passport and lives in southern Arizona. In writing American Nomads, Grant traveled through Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, California, Nevada, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Washington.In this cogent but uneven meditation on American wanderers past and present, British writer Grant, who has written for GQ and Esquire, parallels his own travels through the American Southwest with those of earlier explorers, conquerors, cowboys, Indians, bikers and hoboes. In 1985, the author, without prospects and sick of London's dreary weather, escaped to the U.S. He's spent the past 15 years feeding his "wanderlust, restlessness, itchy feet, antsy pants, white-line fever," crisscrossing the country, but sticking mainly to the Southwest. Along the way, he has grappled with certain questions, internally and in the articles he has written to finance his travels. As he puts it in his prologue, "What drove a man to spend his life in motion? Was it a natural human impulse, recognized and obeyed, or was it a disease of the soul? Why was the type so prevalent in America...?" To find the answers, he hung out at all-night truck stops, chatted with grizzled hitchhikers and rail tramps, and attended love and peace fests (including the popular Rainbow gatherings). He also spent time in libraries, researching the history of the wanderers-both native and European-who came before him. While certain profiles (e.g., of early Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca and mountain man Joe Walker) do absorb, Grant occasionally strays into the extraneous (a too-long chronicle of the horse's introduction into North America and a spotty history of the notorious Freight Train Riders of America are particular examples). It makes for a lively, though sometimes tiring, pastiche of travelogue and regurgitated history.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heroes of the Frontier</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A picaresque adventure and spiritual coming-of-age tale &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>On the Road</i>&nbsp;crossed with <i>Henderson the Rain King</i>...

The happiness of being alone, and tipsy on red wine, in the passenger seat of an ancient recreational vehicle parked somewhere in Alaska&#x2019;s deep south, staring into a scribble of black trees, afraid to go to sleep for fear that at any moment someone will get past the toy lock on the RV door and murder you and your two small children sleeping above.<br> &nbsp;<br> Josie squinted into the low light of a long summer evening at a rest stop in southern Alaska. She was happy this night, with her pinot, in this RV in the dark, surrounded by unknown woods, and became less afraid with every new sip from her yellow plastic cup. She was content, though she knew this was a fleeting and artificial contentment, she knew this was all wrong&#x2014;she should not be in Alaska, not like this. She had been a dentist and was no father of her children, an invertebrate, a loose-boweled man named Carl, a man who had told Josie marriage-by-documentation was a sham, the paper superfluous and reductive, had, eighteen months after he&#x2019;d moved out, found a different woman to marry him. He&#x2019;d met and now was, improbably, impossibly, marrying some other person, a person from Florida. It was happening in September, and Josie was fully justified in leaving, in disappearing until it was all over. Carl had no idea she had taken the children out of Ohio. Almost out of North America. And he could not know. And what could better grant her invisibility than this, a rolling home, no fixed address, a white RV in a state with a million other wayward travelers, all of them in white RVs? No one could ever find her. She&#x2019;d contemplated leaving the country altogether, but Ana didn&#x2019;t have a passport and Carl was needed to get one, so that option was out. Alaska was at once the same country but another country, was almost Russia, was almost oblivion, and if Josie left her phone and used only cash&#x2014;she&#x2019;d brought three thousand dollars in the kind of velvet bag meant to hold gold coins or magic beans&#x2014;she was untraceable, untrackable. And she&#x2019;d been a Girl Scout. She could tie a knot, gut a fish, start a fire. Alaska did not daunt her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She and the kids had landed in Anchorage earlier that day, a grey day without promise or beauty, but the moment she&#x2019;d stepped off the plane she found herself inspired. &#x201c;Okay guys!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said to her exhausted, hungry children. They had never expressed any interest in Alaska, and now here they were. &#x201c;Here we are!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, and she&#x2019;d done a celebratory little march.

Even before the universe was created, God had you in mind, and he planned you for his purposes. These purposes will extend far beyond the few years you will spend on earth. You were made to last forever! Self-help books often suggest that you try to discover the meaning and purpose of your life by looking within yourself, but Rick Warren says that is the wrong place to start. You must begin with God, your Creator, and his reasons for creating you. You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense. This book will help you understand why you are alive and God&#39;s amazing plan for you - both here and now, and for eternity. Rick Warren will guide you through a personal 40-day spiritual journey that will transform your answer to life&#39;s most important question: What on earth am I here for? Knowing God&#39;s purpose for creating you will reduce your stress, focus your energy, simplify your decisions, give meaning to your life, and, most importantly, prepare you for eternity. The Purpose Driven Life is a blueprint for Christian living in the 21st century - a lifestyle based on God&#39;s eternal purposes, not cultural values. Using over 1,200 scriptural quotes and references, it challenges the conventional definitions of worship, fellowship, disciple.</p><p><p>Dr. Rick Warren is pastor, author, global strategist, theologian, and philanthropist.&nbsp; His book<em>The Purpose driven Life</em>has been called the bestselling non-fiction hardback in publishing history by Publishers Weekly, having sold more than 32 million copies.&nbsp; Warren founded Saddleback Church in 1980 with his wife, Kay.&nbsp; In addition to a 120-acre campus in Lake Forest, CA, the church has ten satellite campuses in Southern California and three international campuses.</p></p><h2>Reincarnation: The Phoenix Fire Mystery : An East-West Dialogue on Death and Rebirth from the Worlds of Religion, Science, Psychology, Philosophy</h2><p>This classic anthology offers ancient and modern perspectives on Job&#39;s question: &#39;If a man die, shall he live again?&#39; Spanning over 5,000 years of world thought, the selections invite consideration of an idea that has found hospitality in the greatest minds of history.</p><p>Sylvia Cranston was a reincarnation research specialist for over 40 years, and lectured in the US and abroad.

Reprint.</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The rain pouring down from a grey, sodden sky had turned the gold and red of the October afternoon into a landscape of gloom, with rivulets of water trickling on to the road from the high banks on either side of it and a never ending shower of leaves drifting down from the trees clustered behind them. But the girl squelching along the lane didn't in the least mind the weather; to be in the country, away from chimney pots and little mean streets of small dismal houses and the never ending noise, was contentment. She was going at a good pace, well wrapped against the weather, tendrils of bright chestnut hair hanging bedraggled around her pretty face, wet from the rain. She was a tall girl and well built and even the wringing mackintosh she wore couldn't disguise her splendid figure.<p>There was a dog with her; a black Labrador, his sleek coat soaked, plodding along beside her with evident enjoyment, tongue lolling, his eyes turned to her face every moment or so, listening to her quiet voice. 'So you see, Cuthbert, you'll not have me to take you for walks&#x2014;you'll have to make do with Mike or Natalie when they're home. Of course, I'll come home whenever I can but Yorkshire is a long way.' She came to a halt and stared down at the devoted creature. 'I ought to be feeling very happy, but I'm not. Do you suppose it's wedding nerves? I've got the awful feeling that I don't want to get married at all. Oh, Cuthbert..' She bent right down and twiddled his wet ears, and he licked her hand gently.</p><p>Very few cars came along the lane and what with the noise of the rain and the wind in the trees, she hadn't heard the car coming up the hill behind them; a Bentley, sliding to a dignified halt within a few feet of them. She stood up then, hushed Cuthbert's indignant bark, and went to poke her head through the window by the driver.</p><p>'You should have sounded your horn,' she told the man at the wheel severely. 'You could have run us down.'</p><p>She found herself looking into two of the coldest blue eyes she had ever seen. His voice was just as cold. 'Young lady, I am not in the habit of running anyone or anything down. Is this a private road?'</p><p>'Lord no. It leads to Ridge Giffard from East Giffard and after that there's Tisbury.'</p><p>'I am aware of my surroundings. I was wondering why you had the effrontery to criticise my driving on a public road.'</p><p>Gently the girl's softly curving mouth rounded into an indignant O and her large grey eyes narrowed. A rat trap of a mouth in a rugged, handsome face; pepper and salt hair, cut short, and a commanding nose; she surveyed them without haste. At length she said kindly, in the tone of voice one might use to humour an ill tempered child, 'You're touchy, aren't you? And a stranger to these parts?' She straightened up. 'Well, don't let me keep you. You say you're aware of your surroundings, so I won't need to tell you that they'll be moving the cows across at Pake's Farm a mile along on the next bend.' She added, 'A pedigree herd, too.'</p><p>The man in the car gave a low rumble of laughter although he didn't look amused. 'No, you don't need to tell me, young lady, but I can see that it gives you a good deal of satisfaction to do so.' He asked to surprise her, 'Are you married?'</p><p>And when she shook her head, 'Something for a man to be thankful for.'</p><p>She wasn't in the least put out. 'That could be a compliment,' she told him sweetly. 'Mind how you go.'</p><p>The cold eyes swept over her before he drove away. It was like a bucket of cold water.</p><p>'Anyone else would have offered us a lift,' she told Cuthbert. 'Not that we would have accepted.'</p><p>She started walking again, the afternoon would soon turn into an early evening and they had another mile or so to go.</p><p>The pair of them negotiated a gate presently and took to the fields, going at a right angle to the road, to cross a stile at the end of the second field and come into a narrow lane running between trees. It went quite steeply down hill in a series of bends, passing a cottage or two on the way until the village appeared; a cluster of cottages, a shop or two and half a dozen larger houses, with ancient tiled roofs and eighteenth century fronts. The girl went past them all, waving once or twice to the few people in the street, and turned in through an open gateway at the end of the village. The drive was short, leading to an outbuilding used as a garage and then turning to broaden out before the low, sprawling house. It was built of red brick like most of the houses in the village but it had a thatched roof and mullioned windows and a very solid front door, ignored by the girl who turned down the side of the house, went through a tumbledown stone archway and opened a door leading from the garden.</p><p>The room she went into was small with a stone flagged floor, probably in earlier days a garden room, but now a repository for a collection of shabby coats and mackintoshes, shapeless caps and hats and an untidy row of footwear of all kinds. She took a towel from a peg on the wall, rubbed</p><p>Cuthbert dry and then took off her own mac and opened another door leading this time to a short passage which in its turn ended in the kitchen. A large, low ceilinged room with an old-fashioned scrubbed table in its centre, windsor chairs at either end of it, and a wooden dresser taking up most of one wall. There was an Aga Stove and a rag rug spread before it on the brick floor, occupied by a tabby cat who hardly moved as Cuthbert flung himself down with a contented sigh. There were a number of doors leading from the room, one of which was partly open.</p><p>'Josephine?' asked a muffled voice from behind it, 'is that you, dear? Where did I put the blackcurrant jam&#x2014;I thought it was on the top shelf..'</p><p>The pantry door was pushed open and Mrs Dowling came into the kitchen. They were very alike, mother and daughter, the one still showing signs of the beauty of the other, both with grey eyes and gentle mouths, although Mrs Dowling's hair was heavily streaked with silver.</p><p>'Nice walk?' she asked, forgetting the jam.</p><p>'Lovely. I can't think why I work in London, Mother, when I could spend my days here...'</p><p>'Well, you won't be there much longer, darling. In another month or two you'll be married to Malcolm and I daresay the Yorkshire Moors are just as beautiful as our bit of the country.'</p><p>Josephine cut a slice off the loaf on the table and began to eat it. She said thoughtfully, 'Well, yes, they're beautiful, but they're a long way away.'</p><p>'You'll have Malcolm's mother and father,' her mother pointed out.</p><p>'So I shall,' Josephine agreed slowly. She had fought a long hard battle with herself over her future mother-in-law; they didn't like each other and never would. Josephine, voicing her doubts to Malcolm, had come up against an easy-going amusement which refused to recognise her difficulties. They would settle down nicely, he had assured her, half laughing, it was because they didn't know each other very well, all that would be changed when they saw each other daily. A prospect which made Josephine shudder; Malcolm was going into his father's practice and was perfectly content to live within a stone's throw of his parents' house; it was one of the things which worried her, especially if she were to wake in the night and think about it, although in the morning her worries seemed rather silly.</p><p>She said, 'The jam&#x2014;it's on the bottom shelf, right at the back. I'll get it.' She emerged presently from the cupboard and put the pot on the table. 'I met a man while I was out. In a Bentley&#x2014;I've never seen him before&#x2014;is there someone staying up at the Manor?'</p><p>Mrs Dowling was cutting bread and butter. 'Not that I know of, but the Vicar's wife mentioned someone saying they were staying over at Branton House. She didn't know anything about him, though she'd heard that he was a foreigner.'</p><p>'Never an Arab going to buy the place?'</p><p>'Heaven forbid&#x2014;the Forsyths have been there for hundreds of years. I daresay your father will know.'</p><p>But presently, sitting round the fire in the comfortable, shabby drawing room, she forgot about him. Her father, the local GP, had been at Salisbury Hospital, visiting a patient and an old friend after lunching with colleagues, and the talk was of them and their doings. Presently he got up to take evening surgery. Josephine cleared away the tea things and washed the delicate old china and rubbed up the silver spoons which her mother had always used each day, and then started to prepare the supper. Tomorrow evening, she thought with a sigh, she would be back in London, sitting in her office writing the report; it would be a busy day&#x2014;theatre day&#x2014;the gyny ward was always full but the turnover was brisk and for the most part the patients were very cheerful. She loved her work and she was going to miss it when she married Malcolm. It was only recently that she had had niggling doubts; things that hadn't seemed to matter too much now mattered a great deal; Yorkshire was a far cry from Ridge Giffard and she was essentially a home loving girl. She had always been content, living in the old house, coming home from boarding school and then leaving it to train as a nurse, but even then she had come home on her free days, and now, a Ward Sister and the possessor of a second-hand Mini, she found it easy enough to drive to and fro when she had her free weekends. She would miss Mike and Natalie, she didn't see much of them these days for they were both away from home for a good part of the year, Natalie at school taking her O levels and Mike in his first year at medical school. And the house she and Malcolm were to have&#x2014;it was small and modern and had what she considered to be a pokey little garden. It worried her that she minded that so mu...</p></p><h2>The Railway Children (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>With their father called away, Roberta, Peter, and Phyllis must move with their mother to the country, where they wait each day at the train station in hopes their father will arrive.</p><p>They were not railway children to begin with...

With her husband, Hubert Bland, she was one of the founder members of the socialist Fabian Society; their household became a centre of the socialist and literary circles of the times. E.

Other books featuring the Bastable children followed, and a series of magical fantasy books, including FIVE CHILDREN AND IT also became very popular.

Publisher&#39;s original hardcover, spine stamped in gold.</p><p>YA Beryl Markham was born into the upper crust of British society. She grew up in Africa, having all the privileges of her social position while at the same time assimilating the ways of the native bushmen who worked on her horse farm. She became an aviatrix who was a bush pilot to royalty and the first person to fly the Atlantic solo from west to east. All of her successes and failures are chronicled by Mary Lovell, who spent years researching Straight on Till Morning . She has a genuine affection for her subject. This makes fascinating reading about a woman whose feats would be difficult to duplicate. While doing personal interviews with Beryl Markham, Lovell came across several stories by her published in the 1940s. Three of the stories were ghost written by her third husband, Raoul Schumacher. The others were written by Markham, and all of them are based on her personal experiences. They have been compiled in The Splendid Outcast. These two books, plus Markham's West with the Night (North Point Pr, 1983), provide a clear picture of Markham's life in Africa and the multitude of personal experiences she embraced during her lifetime. Anne Paget, Episcopal High School, Bellaire<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.The republication of West with the Night in 1983 rekindled interest in Beryl Markham, who wrote it in 1936 after her solo flight across the Atlantic. This is the story of a person who lived intenselyshe died at her Kenya home in 1986early on as a wild child raised by a father whose wife left him in Africa with their daughter when she moved back to England. As a teenager and adult, the pioneer aviator made news. Married three times, divorced for infidelity, she had many lovers, among them: Bror Blixen, her friend Isak (Karen) Dinesen's husband, Karen's lover Denys Finch-Hatton and Prince Henry, brother of King George VI. Finch-Hatton and another intimate, Tom Campbell-Black, taught Markham to fly and, ironically, they were both to die in plane crashes. If Lovell, a British freelance writer, intrudes more than necessary into the story, this is nevertheless an engrossing biography of a legendary beauty and achiever who lived fully her 84 years.

This comprehensive reference to the birds of North America includes full-page profiles of more than 930 species -- all the birds known to breed in the United States or Canada, as well as regular visitors and vagrants to the continent. Smithsonian Birds of North America provides essential identification tips for each species together with fascinating information on feeding and behavior, breeding, and nesting habits. Identification. Full-page species profiles combine a precise description and annotated photographs to highlight the key field marks of the adult male. Other plumages are portrayed with photographs or artworks if they differ significantly. Species similar to the one profiled are shown with a brief summary of the key differences. An explanation of the typical flight pattern of each species includes both schematic artworks and a verbal description. Life histories. Knowledge of behavior can be critical to differentiate between similar species, and an understanding of life histories enhances the total birding experience. Each profile includes a description of the typical vocalizations, feeding behavior, breeding, nesting, population, and conservation concerns. A range map shows each bird&#39;s occurrence in North America during summer, winder, and on migration.</p><p>A visit to any of the Smithsonian&#39;s 16 museums and galleries or the National Zoo is an adventure into the world&#39;s largest museum complex. The Smithsonian Institution holds more than 140 million artifacts and specimens in trust for the American people. The Institution, also a center for research, is dedicated to public education, national service, and scholarship in the arts, sciences, and history. The Smithsonian was established in 1846 with funds bequeathed to the United States by James Smithson, an English scientist, for the increase and diffusion of knowledge. The author, Frederick Joseph Alsop, III Ph.D. is an ornithologist and a professor of biological sciences at East Tennessee State University. He received his doctorate in zoology from the University of Tennessee, and specializes in the ecology, distribution, life history, and taxonomy of birds. An avid field biologist and birder, he has identified more than 3,200 species of birds worldwide.With its DK and Smithsonian imprimaturs, this five-pound book will get attention it does not deserve. The information it provides, with sections on identification, song, behavior, breeding, distribution, conservation, etc., is accurate and complete enough but adds little to what is found in the many good books already available on the subject books that are generally smaller, cheaper, and easier to use. Thus, titles by David Sibley, the National Geographic Society, Chandler Robbins, and Roger Tory Peterson serve much better as field guides; Paul Ehrlich's The Birder's Handbook (S. &amp; S., 1988), although under-illustrated, provides more information on the biology of each species. Alsop includes ultra-rare species most advanced birders will not see in a lifetime, giving them unrealistic significance. His photographs, devoid of background and often one per species, appear as mounted specimens and are not helpful for identification. Though it may seem counterintuitive, field guides with stylized, generalized paintings give a much better distillation of a bird's appearance than photographs do. A professor of biological sciences at East Tennessee State University, Alsop has also published smaller Eastern and Western region spin-off titles of this work, with the same text for appropriate species.

Ghost Tracks pulls together five decades of field research experience, along with historic, scientific, and religious perspectives to reveal that even the paranormal have predictable patterns of behavior. These patterns enable the Warrens to discern what is happening and why. Lectures and selected case studies and letters demonstrate what it is like to live with, investigate, and resolve the mystery of ghosts, poltergeist, and evil infestations. Ghost Tracks has a refreshing style making it an easy read, entertaining as well as informative.</p><p>Don't miss Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren in the blockbuster Conjuring films. Just beyond the shadows, in the twilight space between life and death, lies the place where ghosts, demons, and otherworldly horrors tread. For most people, this place is something to be encountered only in their worst nightmares, but for Ed and Lorraine Warren, it is home. As the founders of the New England Society of Psychic Research, the Warrens are the world's most renowned experts in the paranormal, investigating thousands of supernatural events in their long, spectacular careers. And now, in this remarkable book, their story can finally be told. From a murdered boy's terrifying unrest to the Amityville Horror, the Warrens use scientific rigor to investigate impossible claims. Like few others, they have an intimate understanding of evil-and a willingness to battle it wherever it rears its head. In the realm of the supernatural, Ed and Lorraine Warren understand that just because something is impossible doesn't mean it isn't true.For more than fifty years, Lorraine Warren-a validated clairvoyant-and her husband Ed Warren-a respected demonologist-have been studying paranormal phenomena around the world. Their most famous case was Amityville, where they were the only psychic researchers invited to investigate the site shortly after the Lutz family fled the house in terror. The Warrens are popular and respected lecturers and frequent guests on both television and radio. Their work has been the subject of hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, two movies, and now ten books.

Still recovering from injuries received in foiling the plots of the Ferran envoy, Rhenn is preparing to take up his new duties as imager liaison to the Civic Patrol of L&#x20ac;&#x2122;Excelsis. No sooner has he assumed his new position than he discovers two things. First, the Commander of the Civic Patrol doesn&#x20ac;&#x2122;t want a liaison from the infamous Collegium, and soon has Rhenn patrolling the streets of the worst district in the city. Second, Rhenn receives formal notice that one of the High Holders, the father of a man Rhenn partly blinded in self-defense, has declared his intention to destroy Rhenn and his family. Rhenn&#x20ac;&#x2122;s only allies are the family of the girl he loves, successful merchants with underworld connections.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<p>1<br>On Vendrei, the twentieth of Erntyn, just before the bells rang out the seventh glass of the morning, I hurried across the quadrangle of the Collegium to the administration building to meet with Master Dichartyn&#x2014;imager Maitre D&#x2019;Esprit, the director of all security operations for the imagers of Solidar, the second-most senior imager of the Collegium Imago, and my immediate superior. The faint mist that had hovered above the grass earlier had lifted, and the morning was cooler than usual, perhaps foreshadowing the end of harvest and the coming chill of fall. Both moons were high in the morning sky, with Artiema close to full and Erion waning, although they were easy to miss in the white sunlight angling over L&#x2019;Excelsis, sunlight that tended to turn the granite buildings of Imagisle a whitish gray.<br>As I reached the open door to Master Dichartyn&#x2019;s firstfloor study, the first bell rang out from the tower of Anomen d&#x2019;Imagisle.<br>&#x201c;Come in, Rhennthyl.&#x201d;<br>I entered the small room with its single desk and bookcase, and but two chairs. Master Dichartyn stood beside the narrow window with its louvered leaded glass panes cranked full open. He turned and nodded for me to close the door. His dark brown hair was shot with gray, more than even a few months before, it seemed to me, but the circles under his eyes did not seem quite so dark, and his narrow face was not quite so haggard. A faint smile rested on his lips.<br>I closed the door, but did not sit.<br>&#x201c;How are you feeling, Rhenn?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Most of the soreness in my ribs is gone, and Master Draffyd feels that I&#x2019;m ready. He did suggest that I wear the rib brace for another two weeks as a precautionary measure.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Given your ... tendencies, that&#x2019;s doubtless wise.&#x201d; He gestured toward the writing desk, on which rested a silver pin&#x2014;the four-pointed star of the Collegium, encircled by a thin band of silver. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen those, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Only on Master Poincaryt, sir. I wondered if he wore it because he was the head of the Collegium.&#x201d;<br>Master Dichartyn shook his head. &#x201c;You know we don&#x2019;t wear images of rank ... not precisely. The pin merely signifies that you are a master imager, but not what class of master. We&#x2019;ve found that it reduces misunderstandings for those imagers who have to work outside the Collegium. You wouldn&#x2019;t be wearing it except for your assignment as Collegium liaison to the Civic Patrol of L&#x2019;Excelsis.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Go on. Put it on.&#x201d;<br>I picked up the pin and fastened it onto my gray waistcoat&#x2014; the same cut and style as worn by all imagers&#x2014;at the same spot where Master Poincaryt had worn his, just below the point of the left collar of my pale gray shirt.<br>&#x201c;Good. That&#x2019;s where it belongs. Now ... take it off. You only wear it while you&#x2019;re away from the Collegium and on duty with the Patrol&#x2014;or going to or returning from such duty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll report to Commander Artois at eighth glass on Lundi. After that, I imagine you&#x2019;ll have to be there at seventh glass. Do you know where the Patrol headquarters are?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re a block or so up Fedre from East River Road, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Now ...&#x201d; Master Dichartyn fingered his clean-shaven chin, not that any imager was bearded, as he often did when he was considering how to word something precisely. &#x201c;Commander Artois is a solid, sometimes brilliant man. He doesn&#x2019;t like the Collegium, but he does like imagers like you&#x2014;too brave for your own good. He knows that you&#x2019;ve taken out the Ferran and three other assassins.&#x201d;<br>Master Dichartyn smiled wryly. &#x201c;He also doesn&#x2019;t like facts being kept from him, and he&#x2019;s not terribly fond of surmises or other ideas that aren&#x2019;t backed with solid evidence. This could present a certain problem for you.&#x201d;<br>I could see that, because I often felt how things might go long before I could prove it. While I was usually right, I certainly wasn&#x2019;t infallible, and that could prove difficult.<br>&#x201c;Oh ... you might be interested to know that while you were recovering, the First Minister of Ferrum recalled their delegation to Ferrial for consultations and a proper period of mourning for the death of Envoy Vhillar.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did Master Poincaryt have to suggest anything?&#x201d; I wanted to know if the head of the Collegium had been required to use the threat of revealing that Vhillar had been a renegade imager.<br>&#x201c;Apparently not.&#x201d; There was a glint in Master Dichartyn&#x2019;s eyes before he added, &#x201c;The letter of sympathy for the unfortunate accident did mention that Master Poincaryt also sent his regrets for the loss of such an able envoy with talents that were far beyond his portfolio. That was sufficient, it appears.&#x201d;<br>I nodded.<br>&#x201c;From time to time, you will continue to meet with Maitre Dyana, Rhennthyl. Your skills in indirection may be adequate for the civic patrollers, but they leave something to be desired for someone who will need to deal with High Holders in the future.&#x201d;<br>That was a veiled reminder and reprimand all in one. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now ... so far as your new duties go ... you&#x2019;ve studied the procedures manual of the Civic Patrol closely, but remember that events on the street seldom accommodate themselves to written procedures. I&#x2019;m certain that you&#x2019;ve considered this, but wherever possible, let the patrollers have the credit for what happens. If matters go badly, and it is your fault, take the blame. Take all of it. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; What that meant was that matters had better not go badly where I was involved.<br>&#x201c;Do you have any questions?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know enough about my new duties to have questions, and as in so many events of the past year, I had the feeling that by the time I knew enough to ask questions, it would be too late.<br>&#x201c;Unless you run into extreme difficulties, I&#x2019;ll see you here next Jeudi evening at half past five.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Next Jeudi at half past five.&#x201d;<br>He nodded, and I inclined my head in return, then opened the door to the small study, a chamber most modest for the second-most powerful imager in Solidar, and perhaps in the entire world of Terahnar.<br>As I walked across the quadrangle to return to my quarters and to continue my studies of the procedures manual of the Civic Patrol, I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder over the circumstances that had brought me from a journeyman portraiturist to an imager Maitre D&#x2019;Aspect. While I certainly hadn&#x2019;t planned on being an imager, I knew that being an imager was far more palatable to my father than being an artist had been. As an imager, even as a low-level master, I had status, even a hint of power, and that was something my father the wool factor could appreciate, and now that I had a beautiful and acceptable young woman in Seliora interested in me, my mother was hopeful that, despite her Pharsi background, a marriage would be in the offing.<br>There were a few problems with being an imager that they did tend to gloss over, such as my having been wounded twice in the past year, and others that I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned in any detail to them, such as my unresolved difficulties with High Holder Ryel, who was absolutely certain, sooner or later, to try to destroy me in some fashion or another, or the fact that Seliora&#x2019;s family, while certainly wealthy, still possessed certain connections that were highly useful, but not necessarily totally legal.<br>Excerpted from Imager&#x2019;s Challenge by L.

When it comes to hearing a word from God, many people are nervous and fearful. It&#39;s easy to see why so many are so leery of anything related to prophecy. There is perhaps no ministry in the church with more glaring examples of excess and counterfeit expressions than in this area. The truth is God still speaks and the role of prophetic ministry is as vital today as it has ever been in the church - it is real, useful and very much needed. In this book, Wayne Drain and Tom Lane lay a solid biblical foundation for the role of prophecy in the the church today. Using scripture and stories, they systematically deal with questions and objections and show why we should all embrace prophetic ministry today. When prophetic ministry is recognized and embraced by the church in a healthy way, its impact on individuals and influences on the work of the church is powerful!</p><p></p><h2>Where Shall We Run To?</h2><p>A NEW STATESMAN BOOK OF THE YEARFrom one of our greatest living writers, comes a remarkable memoir of a forgotten England.&#39;The war went.

K. Rowling, and tips and suggestions made by millions of fans to offer speculations concerning the contents of the seventh and final volume in the blockbuster series. Original.</p><p>What more can we say. Teenagers who start a Harry Potter fan site that now gets 20 millions hits per month and is so good, popular and famous that J.K. Rowling gives it an award on her personal website and grants the founder an interview with her (and she doesn&#39;t give many interviews).Snape<br><br>Severus Snape is a dark and complex character: an exciting mix of the good (when he keeps saving Harry&#x2019;s life), the bad (his murder of Dumbledore springs to mind), and the ugly (enough said). In other words, he&#x2019;s a bit of a git and he knows it. He&#x2019;s been a Death Eater in the past, and for all we know he could still be one right now. One minute he&#x2019;s going out of his way to save Harry&#x2019;s life during a Quidditch match [SS11] and the next he is sneering at him with all his might. Just what is it with Snape, and what on earth is going on in that twisted mind of his? And most importantly of all, whose side is he really on?<br>What can be in no doubt is that Severus Snape is, on the face of it, a very unpleasant man. Questions of loyalty aside, when he was a teacher he repeatedly delighted in using his position to bully students he&#x2019;d taken a dislike to (i.e. those who weren&#x2019;t from Slytherin), and to blatantly favour his own house. He is petty, vindictive, and able to bear grudges for enormous lengths of time. For this he is universally disliked (except by Slytherin students of course), mainly due to the fact that he is so fundamentally unlikeable.<br>On the other hand, he&#x2019;s quite obviously a brilliant wizard with an exceptional amount of talent. He&#x2019;s a fantastic Occlumens and Legilimens, and we shouldn&#x2019;t forget that he was unquestioningly trusted by Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard of the age. There&#x2019;s also the small matter of him being the only man ever to have successfully defected from the ranks of the Death Eaters [GOF30], if he did in fact turn spy for the Order of the Phoenix against Voldemort and not the other way around.<br>The two sides of Severus Snape don&#x2019;t sit very happily together, and they leave a huge question mark hanging over him, particularly with regard to where his loyalties lie. Suspicions have been raised right from the start of the series that he has secretly been working for Voldemort all along, and that despite what Dumbledore says, he never genuinely left the Death Eaters at all. There are an awful lot of people who think that Snape&#x2019;s story of defecting from the Dark Lord&#x2019;s ranks and returning to spy on him was an elaborate lie upheld by his skill in Occlumency, whilst he was really spying on the Order of the Phoenix for his Dark master.<br>Killing Dumbledore didn&#x2019;t help much, of course (assuming that Dumbledore is really dead) [HBP27]. Doing that sort of thing was hardly likely to endear him to the Order, or make people see him as one of the goodies. Having said that, there&#x2019;s also a lot to be said that makes him seem pretty cool after all. What we really need to do is to make sense of the whole thing, and so in this chapter we reveal once and for all whose side he is really on!<br>As you&#x2019;d expect there&#x2019;s a huge amount of information on Snape contained in HBP, but the evidence starts well before this: on the very first night Harry sets eyes on his Potions teacher in 1991, in fact [SS7]. One thing that&#x2019;s for sure is that JK has deliberately set Snape up to be a mystery, and so there are frequent contradictions and a huge number of red herrings. But if you look at it carefully enough, you always arrive at the same place: Snape is one of the good guys. He might not be nice, and he might have revoltingly greasy hair, but he is on the side of good and always will be. What follows is an explanation of why, and an exploration of what his allegiance is likely to lead him to do in Book 7.<br><br>Snape&#x2019;s Double Life: How to Judge His Loyalty<br><br>A lot of people believe that JK thoroughly debunked the &#x201c;Snape is Good&#x201d; theory in the MuggleNet/Leaky Cauldron interview (July 2005), and will already be thinking that what we&#x2019;re saying here is a pile of garbage (to put it politely) just because of that. If you look at it carefully, though, you&#x2019;ll see that there&#x2019;s no debunking of any type going on. All JK does is avoid the question, which tells us nothing (apart from the fact that it&#x2019;s important and she doesn&#x2019;t want to talk about it). What was said is this:<br><br>MA: OK, big big big book six question. Is Snape evil?<br><br>JKR: Well, okay, I'm obviously &#x2013; Harry-Snape is now as personal, if not more so, than Harry-Voldemort. I can't answer that question because it's a spoiler, isn't it, whatever I say, and obviously, it has such a huge impact on what will happen when they meet again that I can't. And let's face it, it's going to launch 10,000 theories and I'm going to get a big kick out of reading them so [laughs]. I'm evil but I just like the theories, I love the theories.<br><br>Is that really someone confidently debunking a theory? Or is it someone floundering around and attempting to avoid the question? You&#x2019;re free to make up your own mind, but as far as this book is concerned, we need a bit more than that! We need cold hard facts, and we need to know how to interpret them.<br>The important thing to remember is that whatever side Snape is truly on, and whatever he is only pretending to be, he must still make some concessions to the part he is acting. In other words, if he is really evil but pretending to be loyal to Dumbledore, he still has to perform some duties for the Order correctly and supply Dumbledore with some (non-vital) information about the Dark Lord and his plans in order to keep his cover. If he is really loyal to Dumbledore but pretending to be a Death Eater then he must similarly pass some accurate information about the Order to Voldemort.<br>His true loyalties can be judged by what he does that he didn&#x2019;t have to do just to keep up any pretense...</p><h2>Everything Flowers</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

The eccentric Canadian pianist (1932-1982) is shown as a hypochondriac, a substance abuser dependent on Valium, Nembutal, etc., a recluse who used and discarded people. He concocted a Machiavellian scheme whereby he would announce his retirement, then stockpile tapes of secret performances while his records soared in value. Kazdin speculates that the pianist may have had a romantic relationship with Cornelia Foss, wife of composer Lucas Foss, but concludes that "the piano was his mistress." There is much about Gould's bizarre idiosyncrasies as well as details of recording sessions and appreciations of his unconventional playing, plus a discography of his recordings for Columbia. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scouting on Two Continents</h2><p>This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

Based on extensive research of the Bible and other sources, <i>The Late Great United States</i> provides compelling and often surprising answers to questions like these:<br>�Does the Bible say anything about America in the last days?<br>�How could the U.S. fit into God&#x2019;s prophetic plan? <br>�Will America survive?<br>�Might the anti-Christ come from America?<br>�Could America&#x2019;s addiction to oil be her undoing?<br>�Will America be destroyed by a nuclear attack?<br>�Could America fall from within as a result of moral corruption? <br>�Is America still a &#x201c;blessed&#x201d; nation?<br>�How should individual Christians respond to a world in chaos?<br><i><br></i>Regardless of America's final fate and the outcome of dire events at the end of the age, Hitchcock urges us to find our hope in a God who will not forsake us&#x2013;no matter what cataclysms we experience on earth.</p><p>Mark Hitchcock, Ph.D., an authority on Bible prophecy, has written fifteen books on the topic, including <i>Iran: The Coming Crisis</i>. A law school graduate, Mark was called to the ministry in the 1980s. After graduation from seminary, he became pastor of Faith Bible church in Edmond, Oklahoma, where he still serves. Mark lectures frequently on prophecy themes and has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN. Mark and his wife, Cheryl, have two sons, Justin and Samuel.<i>I turn back to your prophets in the Old Testament and the signs foretelling Armageddon, and I find myself wondering if we are the generation that is going to see that come about. I don&#x2019;t know if you have noted any of those prophecies lately, but, believe me, they describe the times we are going through.<br></i><b>&#x2014;President Ronald Reagan, 1983<br></b><br>Suppose someone wrote and published the ultimate compendium of music history...but left out any mention of Beethoven, the Beatles, or Garth Brooks.<br><br>Or the French produced a video tour of Paris...with nary a glimpse of Notre Dame, the Louvre, or the Eiffel Tower.<br><br>Imagine a math textbook containing an entire year&#x2019;s curriculum...never once using or discussing the number one.<br><br>When an authoritative resource claims expertise in a particular field of knowledge, we usually expect it to touch on the most prominent subjects within its purview.That&#x2019;s why somany Christians read their Bibles&#x2014;and biblical prophetic passages in particular&#x2014;fully confident that it must somehow reveal something about the role of America in the end times. After all, God, who exists in all times, who sees the end of history from the beginning, who indeed sovereignly governs every moment of history&#x2014;God, who reveals key end-time events in the prophecies of Scripture, can&#x2019;t possibly have omitted from His opus the most powerful, most influential, and by many counts most God-blessed of all nations that have ever risen.<br><br>Can He?<br><br>By any standard of measurement, America occupies center stage in the world arena. No one disputes the fact that America has a distinctive history, during which it has risen to dominate global affairs. In a quarter of a millennium it has become a nation unlike any other in the history of the world. It has superseded nations with much longer histories. No nation in the history of civilization has exercised greater influence than the United States of America&#x2014; politically, militarily, economically, culturally, linguistically, and possibly even religiously. As the old saying goes, &#x201c;When America sneezes, the world catches a cold.&#x201d;<br><br>Most of America&#x2019;s ascent has happened in less than one hundred years. America&#x2019;s awe-inspiring rise to superpower status in the twentieth century accelerated to maximum upward velocity in the aftermath of WWII. In an ironic twist, the war&#x2019;s tragic losses delivered America from the poverty of the Great Depression. The United States emerged fromWWII better off militarily, politically, and economically than any other nation. Even during the dark days of the cold war, America had the upper hand on the Soviet Union, as was finally proven in the early 1990s when the Soviet Empire unraveled at the seams and America found herself alone at the top.<br><br><b>The Last Superpower<br><br></b>Today, America prevails as the world&#x2019;s lone superpower. The last contender standing. But the &#x201c;champ&#x2019;s&#x201d; reign hasn&#x2019;t been the smooth ride that many optimistically envisioned. From the 1950s through the 1980s, many believed that the demise of the Soviet Union would ensure greater global security.<br>Americans envisioned a brave new world free from the tyranny of Soviet communism. Like many dreams, top-dog status hasn&#x2019;t been what most people expected.<br><br>We inaugurated the single-superpower era with the first Gulf War in theearly 1990s. Operation Desert Storm was a glowing success. The future looked bright. But then the real trouble started. The under- ground garage bombing of the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, was the first assault of Islamic terror on American soil&#x2014;a dark omen of things to come. Gathering stormclouds loomed closer with the suicide bombing attack on the USS <i>Cole </i>in 2000.<br><br>Then dawned the darkest day in American history&#x2014;the devastating attack of 9/11&#x2014;plunging America headlong into the age of radical Islamic jihad. Radical Islam declared open war on the United States. The stunning attack gripped the nation, a portent of many more to come. America and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and launched the Iraq War in 2003&#x2014;a war that has cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives. And most recently? Economic meltdown. Skyrocketing oil prices. The subprime mortgage crisis. The dollar&#x2019;s devaluation to all-time lows. Foreign nations, awash in oil money, buying major U.S. financial institutions. Runaway deficits and an out-of-control federal budget. Smothering debt.The looming threat of radical Islam.<br><br>And the worst fear of all&#x2014;weapons of mass destruction on American soil. <br><br>Many are openly saying that anything less than victory in the currently festering conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will weaken America&#x2019;s resolve, embolden the jihadists, and force the United States to abdicate its role as world leader and to retreat into isolation.<br><br>America&#x2019;s past is glorious and inspiring. Its present is unstable, yet studded with glimmers of cautious optimism.<br><br>But what of the future? Is there any sure word?<br><br><b>Americans, the Future, and the Bible<br><br></b>The increasingly frantic tempo of change in modern life fosters a global sense of impending crisis. People everywhere fear that the world is moving rapidly toward some calamity&#x2014;possibly even a finale. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve sometimes wondered what&#x2019;s going to come of all the danger, uncertainty, and instability.<br>How long can the tensions be held in check? How long until the lid blows off? Terrorism&#x2014;that Bad Thing that used to happen in other places&#x2014;has rudely intruded into the life of every American. U.S. troops are still in Iraq, still in Afghanistan. Some predict that we might realistically be there for ten years, or longer. The epochal conflict with jihadist terror is still in its infancy. What happens when it grows up?<br><br>The danger and uncertainty of modern civilization has caused people from all walks of life to ask forward-peering questions as never before. Solemn questions. Searching questions. Questions about the Middle East. Terrorism. Radical Islam. Israel. Global pandemics. Drastic weather change. Questions about the future.<br><br>But the real issue that seems to lurk, thinly veiled, behind all these questions is: Could we be nearing closing time? The Bible is the only authority for addressing this question, and Americans seem to be discussing biblical prophecy more than ever before. Many believe that the Bible contains the answers about earth&#x2019;s final days. <br><br>Here&#x2019;s a brief sample of what Americans believe about the book of Revelation and the end times:<br><br>� 59 percent believe that the prophecies in Revelation are going to<br>come true.<br><br>� Nearly 25 percent believe that the Bible predicted the September 11<br>attack.<br><br>� 35 percent are paying more attention to how news events might<br>relate to the end of the world.<br><br>� 17 percent believe the end of the world will happen in their lifetime.<br><br>It&#x2019;s clear that most Americans look to the Bible as an accurate guide for the future. It&#x2019;s also evident that the collective American angst about our world&#x2019;s destiny is building. The fuse is lit. There&#x2019;s fire in the hole. Now we&#x2019;re just wondering how long till it&#x2019;s all gonna blow.<br><br>As we look into the pages of the Bible, we quickly discover that, as alarming as current events might be, they don&#x2019;t surprise God. The geopolitical situation we see today in the headlines bears a remarkable correspondence to the trend of world events that Bible prophecies foretold millennia ago. As we probe God&#x2019;s Word for clues, we discover the You Are Here arrow marking our current position in God&#x2019;s unfolding program, and we notice that some predicted events may occur in our lifetime. Prophecies, which in the past were sometimes carelessly brushed aside as unbelievable, are sparking renewed<br>interest. But perhaps no issue has created more interest than the possible role of America in the end times. This is the question that people everywhere are asking. It&#x2019;s the question that this book will seek to answer.<br><br><b>Inquiring Minds Want to Know<br><br></b>On January 29, 2008, I had the privilege of appearing on a national television program in Texas. After the program, one of the station employees gave me a ride tomy next appointment.We talked as we drove, and I learned that he pastors a new church in the area.We discussed various aspects of pastoral ministry and church life, and before long the topic turned to Bible prophecy. As we neared our destination, he said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s one question that I have wondered about more than any other issue related to Bible prophecy.&#x201d; <br><br>I knew what he was going to ask. &#x201c;Where do you think America fits into biblical prophecy?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m asked this question more&#x2014;much more&#x2014;than any other. People ask me this question at churches, at conferences, on radio and television programs. And as I have talked with my friends and colleagues who teach around the United States and around the world, they confirm that the most-asked question in all of Bible prophecy is: What is America&#x2019;s role in the end times? Something inside us wants to know what will ultimately happen to this great land we call the United States of America.<br><br>Bible prophecy experts Thomas Ice and Timothy Demy address this nagging question:<br><br>&#x201c;God bless America!&#x201d; Is it a prayer, a promise, or a prophecy? We can see and hear the slogan in music, on bumper stickers, in casual conversations, in campaign rhetoric, at historic moments in our nation&#x2019;s life (both joyful and sorrowful), from podiums, in parades, and in a host of other public and religious forums.Will God bless the United States in the future? Is there any sure word of our nation&#x2019;s future in the Bible generally, and the prophetic passages specifically? It&#x2019;s amazing!

From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs Tiggy-winkle, Mr Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood.A source of inspiration was the Lake District where she lived for the last thirty years of her life as a farmer and conservationist.From more than 1400 extant letters, Taylor has chosen 400 that range over the whole course of Potter's life. Drawings are reproduced on nearly every other page, the famous "picture letters" are printed in facsimile, and a few pages of color plates appear. Naturally, much of the correspondence concerns her books and their illustrations, and even a casual reader will be struck by her intense involvement in their publication. Politics, farm, and family business also enter the letters, bringing fascinating glimpses of war and social change even in the countryside. Potter's love of nature is everywhere apparent, but on other aspects of her emotional life the letters are mostly silent. Taylor's linking annotations make this book a satisfying complement to her Beatrix Potter (Warne, 1986) and to the reissue of The Journal of Beatrix Potter (Viking, 1990), revised to include some material (jokes and comments about church affairs) omitted from the 1966 edition.<br><i>- Patricia Dooley, Univ. of Washington Lib.

They open only later in the afternoon and evening, perfuming the night air with their sweet scents. The most magnificent of these late-bloomers is the moonflower. Moonflowers look like white morning glories, except that their blossoms are enormous--up to eight inches across. Each bloom only lasts one night, but the scent more than makes up for the short performance. Just as nature lends itself to day and night creations, so there are &#34;morning people&#34; who feel their best in the early hours of the day and &#34;night people&#34; who seem to bloom after dark. If you are a late bloomer, fill the night air with the sweet fragrance of prayer before God this evening. The Lord looks forward to your companionship and is waiting to hear from you. Give Him your attention and listen to what He wants to tell you. Treat God as you would a dear friend. As you spend time seeking God during the night, you will bring a sweet fragrance into the throne room of God. Enjoy your night glories.</p><p></p><h2>IBERIA -3</h2><p>From the glories of the Prado to the danger and dazzle of the bullfights, master storyteller James A.

WHAT IF YOU COULD CHANGE IT BACK?<br> <br>In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King&#x2014;who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer&#x2014;takes readers on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it.<br> <br>It begins with Jake Epping, a thirty-five-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away&#x2014;a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than fifty years ago when Harry Dunning&#x2019;s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life&#x2014;like Harry&#x2019;s, like America&#x2019;s in 1963&#x2014;turning on a dime. Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession&#x2014;to prevent the Kennedy assassination.<br> <br>So begins Jake&#x2019;s new life as George Amberson, in a different world of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there&#x2019;s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading eventually, of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful, and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable. Or so terrifying.</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation,</i> <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy, <i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Peering through a tiny crack in the curtains, I could see the words REGISTERED and INSURED stamped on it in big red letters. For the first time I thought he seemed furtive and nervous, actually looking around at his exterior surroundings instead of at the spooky furniture deep in his head. I knew what was in the package: a 6.5mm Carcano rifle&#x2014;also known as a Mannlicher-Carcano&#x2014;complete with scope, purchased from Klein&#x2019;s Sporting Goods in Chicago. Five minutes after he climbed the outside stairs to the second floor, the gun Lee would use to change history was in a closet above my head. Marina took the famous pictures of him holding it just outside my living room window six days later, but I didn&#x2019;t see it. That was a Sunday, and I was in Jodie. As the tenth grew closer, those weekends with Sadie had become the most important, the <i>dearest,</i> things in my life. <br><br>9 <br><br>I came awake with a jerk, hearing someone mutter &#x201c;Still not too late&#x201d; under his breath. I realized it was me and shut up. <br><br>Sadie murmured some thick protest and turned over in bed. The familiar squeak of the springs locked me in place and time: the Candlewood Bungalows, April 5, 1963. I fumbled my watch from the nightstand and peered at the luminous numbers. It was quarter past two in the morning, which meant it was actually the sixth of April. <br><br><i>Still not too late.</i> <br><br>Not too late for what? To back off, to let well enough alone? Or bad enough, come to that? The idea of backing off was attractive, God knew. If I went ahead and things went wrong, this could be my last night with Sadie. Ever. <br><br><i>Even if you do have to kill him, you don&#x2019;t have to do it right away.</i> <br><br>True enough. Oswald was going to relocate to New Orleans for awhile after the attempt on the general&#x2019;s life&#x2014;another shitty apartment, one I&#x2019;d already visited&#x2014;but not for two weeks. That would give me plenty of time to stop his clock. But I sensed it would be a mistake to wait very long. I might find reasons to keep on waiting. The best one was beside me in this bed: long, lovely, and smoothly naked. Maybe she was just another trap laid by the obdurate past, but that didn&#x2019;t matter, because I loved her. And I could envision a scenario&#x2014;all too clearly&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d have to run after killing Oswald. Run where? Back to Maine, of course. Hoping I could stay ahead of the cops just long enough to get to the rabbit-hole and escape into a future where Sadie Dunhill would be . . . well . . . about eighty years old. If she were alive at all. Given her cigarette habit, that would be like rolling six the hard way. <br><br>I got up and went to the window. Only a few of the bungalows were occupied on this early-spring weekend. There was a mud- or manure-splattered pickup truck with a trailer full of what looked like farm implements behind it. An Indian motorcycle with a sidecar. A couple of station wagons. And a two-tone Plymouth Fury. The moon was sliding in and out of thin clouds and it wasn&#x2019;t possible to make out the color of the car&#x2019;s lower half by that stuttery light, but I was pretty sure I knew what it was, anyway. <br><br>I pulled on my pants, undershirt, and shoes. Then I slipped out of the cabin and walked across the courtyard. The chilly air bit at my bed-warm skin, but I barely felt it. Yes, the car was a Fury, and yes, it was white over red, but this one wasn&#x2019;t from Maine <i>or</i> Arkansas; the plate was Oklahoma, and the decal in the rear window read GO, SOONERS. I peeked in and saw a scatter of textbooks. Some student, maybe headed south to visit his folks on spring break. Or a couple of horny teachers taking advantage of the Candlewood&#x2019;s liberal guest policy. <br><br>Just another not-quite-on-key chime as the past harmonized with itself. I touched the trunk, as I had back in Lisbon Falls, then returned to the bungalow. Sadie had pushed the sheet down to her waist, and when I came in, the draft of cool air woke her up. She sat, holding the sheet over her breasts, then let it drop when she saw it was me. <br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t sleep, honey?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I had a bad dream and went out for some air.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What was it?&#x201d; <br><br>I unbuttoned my jeans, kicked off my loafers. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Try. My mother always used to say if you tell your dreams, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>I got into bed with her wearing nothing but my undershirt. &#x201c;<i>My</i> mother used to say if you kiss your honey, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Did she actually say that?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said thoughtfully, &#x201c;it sounds possible. Let&#x2019;s try it.&#x201d; <br><br>We tried it. <br><br>One thing led to another. <br><br>10 <br><br>Afterward, she lit a cigarette. I lay watching the smoke drift up and turn blue in the occasional moonlight coming through the half-drawn curtains. <i>I&#x2019;d never leave the curtains that way at Neely Street,</i> I thought. <i>At Neely Street, in my other life, I&#x2019;m always alone but still careful to close them all the way. Except when I&#x2019;m peeking, that is. Lurking.</i> <br><br>Just then I didn&#x2019;t like myself very much. <br><br>&#x201c;George?&#x201d; <br><br>I sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my name.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br>I looked at her. She inhaled deeply, enjoying her cigarette guiltlessly, as people do in the Land of Ago. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any inside information, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re thinking. But it stands to reason. The rest of your past is made up, after all. And I&#x2019;m glad. I don&#x2019;t like George all that much. It&#x2019;s kind of . . . what&#x2019;s that word you use sometimes? . . . kind of dorky.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;How does Jake suit you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;As in Jacob?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I like it.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;In the Bible, Jacob wrestled an angel. And you&#x2019;re wrestling, too. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I am, but not with an angel.&#x201d; Although Lee Oswald didn&#x2019;t make much of a devil, either. I liked George de Mohren--schildt better for the devil role. In the Bible, Satan&#x2019;s a tempter who makes the offer and then stands aside. I hoped de Mohrenschildt was like that. <br><br>Sadie snubbed her cigarette. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were dark. &#x201c;Are you going to be hurt?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you going away? Because if you have to go away, I&#x2019;m not sure I can stand it. I would have died before I said it when I was there, but Reno was a nightmare. Losing you for good . . .&#x201d; She shook her head slowly. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not sure I could stand that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I want to marry you,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;Just when I&#x2019;m ready to say it&#x2019;ll never happen, Jake-alias-George says right now.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not right now, but if the next week goes the way I hope it does . . . will you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Of course. But I <i>do</i> have to ask one teensy question.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Am I single? Legally single? Is that what you want to know?&#x201d; <br><br>She nodded. <br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>She let out a comic sigh and grinned like a kid. Then she sobered. &#x201c;Can I help you? Let me help you.&#x201d; <br><br>The thought turned me cold, and she must have seen it. Her lower lip crept into her mouth. She bit down on it with her teeth. &#x201c;That bad, then,&#x201d; she said musingly. <br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put it this way: I&#x2019;m currently close to a big machine full of sharp teeth, and it&#x2019;s running full speed. I won&#x2019;t allow you next to me while I&#x2019;m monkeying with it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;When is it?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Your . . . I don&#x2019;t know . . . your date with destiny?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Still to be determined.&#x201d; I had a feeling that I&#x2019;d said too much already, but since I&#x2019;d come this far, I decided to go a little farther. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s going to happen this Wednesday night. Something I have to witness. Then I&#x2019;ll decide.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is there no way I can help you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so, honey.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If it turns out I can&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I appreciate that. And you really will marry me?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Now that I know your name is Jake?

Engagingly written for a lay audience, these essays consider a wealth of topics centered on the ethical, spiritual, mythic, and moral resonances in the adventures of Aslan, the Pevensie children, and the rest of the colorful cast. Do the spectacular events in Narnia give readers a simplistic view of human choice and decision making? Does Aslan offer a solution to the problem of evil? What does the character of Susan tell readers about Lewis&#39;s view of gender? How does Lewis address the Nietzschean &#34;master morality&#34; embraced by most of the villains of the Chronicles?

In America&#39;s Longest Siege, Joseph Kelly examines the nation&#39;s long struggle with its &#34;peculiar institution&#34; through the hotly contested debates in the city at the center of the slave trade. From the earliest slave rebellions to the Nullification crisis to the final, tragic act of secession that doomed both the city and the South as a whole, Kelly captures the toxic mix of nationalism, paternalism, and unprecedented wealth that made Charleston the focus of the nationwide debate over slavery. Kelly also explores the dissenters who tried--and ultimately failed--to stop the oncoming Civil War. Exhaustingly researched and also compulsively readable, America&#39;s Longest Siege offers an insightful new take on the war and the culture that made it inevitable.</p><p><strong>Joseph Kelly</strong> is a professor of literature at the College of Charleston&nbsp;and a member of the American Studies Association. He lives in Charleston,&nbsp;South Carolina."Far more than the saga of the prolonged military investment by Union forces of an iconic Confederate city and critical port, Joseph Kelly&#x2019;s <i>America&#x2019;s Longest Siege</i> lays bare the decades-long campaign of rationalization and intimidation that revivified and reinforced the institution of slavery and dragged the United States into disunion and civil war. As well as a vividly written, deeply researched work of historical scholarship, this masterful study is a timely and important reminder of the consequences that result when ideological extremists succeed in drowning out the voices of reason." &#x2014;Peter Quinn, author of <i>The Hour of the Cat</i><br><br>"By placing Charleston at the epicenter of his study, Kelly's eminently readable history is in the company of a number of books that are devoted to exploring the peculiarity of South Carolina's antebellum politics. Throughout, Kelly's literary sensibilities are on display and he regularly humanizes such historical events." &#x2014;<i>Civil War Book Review</i><br><br>"Kelly brings a literary sensibility to this vivid and engrossing study of slavery in and around one of its trading hubs, Charleston, SC, site of the first and longest Civil War siege and a hotbed of political, economic, religious, and moral debates about importing, owning, and trading slaves. Well written and finely detailed, Kelly&#x2019;s debut historical work is an important contribution to Southern antebellum history and is highly recommended to scholarly readers." &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>Advance praise for <i>America's Longest Siege</i>:&nbsp;<p><br>"An elucidating study by a Charleston historian who sees the shadow of nullification still looming." --<i>Kirkus Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Joseph Kelly's compelling new book, <i>America's Longest Siege</i>, vividly and accurately portrays Charleston as 'ground zero' in America's long struggle over slavery." --Robert N. Rosen, author of <i>Confederate Charleston</i> and <i>A Short History of Charleston</i></p><p><br><br>"Joseph Kelly has written a provocative and multilayered analysis of the siege mentality in Charleston and the South prior to the Civil War. Kelly, a professor of literature and American studies, brings a literary sensibility to the craft of history writing, and the result is a joy to read. In addition to the military aspects of siege during the years of civil war, <i>America's Longest Siege</i> addresses the siege of Africans and the siege of rhetoric, especially the ideological arguments of economic self-interest versus enlightened human rights. Original and illuminating, this book tackles profound questions of power and manipulation. This thoughtful and rewarding study should be taken seriously by scholars and enjoyed by general readers. It is an essential contribution to American history." -&#x2014;Orville Vernon Burton, Professor of History, Clemson University, and author of <i>The Age of Lincoln</i></p></p><h2>Living in Morocco</h2><p><strong>Once upon a time in a land not so far away: Arabian Nights in contemporary Morocco</strong> &nbsp; Though it lies just across the Mediterranean from Europe, barely a stone&#x2019;s throw from Spain&#x2019;s southernmost tip, Morocco couldn&#x2019;t possibly be farther away.

Too much damage had been done to the anterior wall to hope for a recovery. He knew it, and so did his daughter, Cordie, who sat by his side in the critical care unit and prayed for a miracle.</p><p>Her father was hooked to a plethora of machines by a series of tubes and IVs. The constant beep from the heart monitor was a comfort to Cordie because it assured her that, even though his eyes were closed and his breathing was shallow, he was still alive. She wouldn&#x2019;t leave him, not even for a minute, fearing he would take his last breath alone in the cold, sterile environment while machines sounded his passing with wailing alarms.</p><p>Cordie&#x2019;s life had come to a screeching halt at eleven o&#x2019;clock Friday night when she got the news. She had just arrived home from a charity event at St. Matthew&#x2019;s High School for Boys, and she was exhausted. Her day had started at six fifteen in the morning when she left her brownstone to go to work. After teaching three chemistry classes and two biology classes, she graded papers during study period, supervised two lab experiments, broke up a fight, and filled in for a math teacher who was home with stomach flu. Then, once the students had been dismissed for the day, she, along with most of the other underpaid teachers, helped transform the gymnasium into a Monte Carlo atmosphere for the annual charity auction. The remainder of the evening was spent serving soft drinks and smiling at donors until her face felt frozen.</p><p>She had been teaching at St. Matthew&#x2019;s for three years while she finished her PhD. The school was located on the edge of Chicago&#x2019;s south side, a rough area of the city, to be sure, but thus far she hadn&#x2019;t had any real trouble. A ten-foot-high wrought-iron fence that had been there since the school was built surrounded the property and the parking area, and she had to drive only two blocks from the highway exit to get to it. There was always a guard at the gate. An anonymous benefactor had made a substantial contribution to the school with the condition that there would be a guard on duty at all times, and ever since the principal had hired the highly recommended security firm, the number of slashed tires and smashed windshields had plummeted.</p><p>Although her father wouldn&#x2019;t admit it, Cordie suspected he was the benefactor. When she started working at the school, he became a staunch supporter. He even took over the auto shop classes when the regular instructor quit in the middle of the semester. The boys could be difficult. Most of them were high risk, but her father didn&#x2019;t have any problem controlling them. He&#x2019;d grown up in New Jersey and, even now, after all these years living in Chicago, still had a bit of a Jersey accent and a tough-guy fa�ade. He treated the boys with respect, and they responded in kind. His gruff, no-nonsense attitude and his enthusiasm won them over. The fact that he had built a national chain of auto repair shops from the ground up didn&#x2019;t hurt. In the eyes of his otherwise cynical students it gave him credibility. While he was teaching the class, attendance was one hundred percent.</p><p>She knew it couldn&#x2019;t have been easy for him raising her alone. It had always been just the two of them. There weren&#x2019;t any relatives on either side of the family. Her mother had died when Cordie was a baby, so of course she didn&#x2019;t have any memories of her. Her father told her she looked like her mother, but he never shared any stories about her. Cordie believed it was too painful for him to talk about losing the love of his life.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t ready to lose him. He was her dad. He had always been . . . indestructible. Until his first heart attack six months ago, he had never been sick, never missed a day of work. Cordie depended on him for strength when times were difficult, and he was always there for her. Always.</p><p>When she had first entered the ICU room, the shock nearly undid her. A priest was standing over him administering the last rites. She barely recognized her father, and she stood there paralyzed with fear. He was a big man, almost six feet, with a muscular frame, but he looked so much smaller in the hospital bed, so weak and vulnerable.</p><p>Now, sitting next to him, she was overwhelmed with the need to help him. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she impatiently wiped them away. It took several minutes for her to gain control of her emotions. If he opened his eyes, she didn&#x2019;t want him to see her crying.</p><p>A senior cardiology resident came in to check on her father and assured her that he was resting comfortably. He couldn&#x2019;t tell her how long it would be before his heart stopped beating.</p><p>&#x201c;The heart is an amazing organ,&#x201d; he told her.</p><p>&#x201c;Then he could get better,&#x201d; she whispered, clinging to the possibility.</p><p>Snatching her hope away, he shook his head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Dr. Platte explained the severity&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She interrupted. &#x201c;Yes, he explained.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The damage&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she interrupted again. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dying.&#x201d;</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t let herself believe it, though. Oh God, please don&#x2019;t let him die.</p><p>She knew she wasn&#x2019;t being rational, pleading for the impossible. She was a fully grown woman, yet sitting there watching him she felt like a little girl again. And she was so scared.</p><p>She took hold of his hand. She wanted him to know she was there and that he wasn&#x2019;t alone. Gradually her panic began to ease. The initial shock wore off, and she was calm once again.</p><p>As she sat there hour after hour, she thought about her father&#x2019;s life. He really was a remarkable man. When she was just a toddler, he went back to school to finish his college degree in business. To support them, he worked as a mechanic in a tiny auto shop. By the time she was five years old, he owned that shop and four more. Then he expanded to sixteen shops in neighboring cities. By her tenth birthday, Kane Automotive was nationwide, and her father was a multimillionaire. Last year he&#x2019;d sold the company, which had grown to more than twelve hundred shops around the country, but he still tinkered in his garage rebuilding old cars just for the love of the work.</p><p>There was never a time he wasn&#x2019;t busy. Yet he was always in the front row for any of her school events. He took her to dance classes and piano lessons and never missed a recital. He was at every parent-teacher night as well. And how many times did he put up with all those sleepovers with her two best friends, Regan and Sophie? Three little girls who giggled over everything must have driven him crazy, but he took it all in stride. The countless trips to the art museum, the zoo, the science exhibits, and the children&#x2019;s movies she wanted to see again and again&#x2014;her dad had the patience of a saint. W hen he wasn&#x2019;t teaching her how to rebuild an engine or change the oil, he was monitoring her schoolwork. Smiling at the memories, she realized how very blessed she was to have such a great father.</p><p>Around two in the morning she dozed off. She awakened with a start when he squeezed her hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Cordie.&#x201d;</p><p>She jumped up and moved closer to the bed. She thought his complexion wasn&#x2019;t quite as gray, and he seemed surprisingly alert.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you, Dad,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you, too.&#x201d; He took a breath and said, &#x201c;This one wasn&#x2019;t like the other two. It snuck up on me and grabbed me from behind. It felt like my heart was being squeezed by a vice. Dropped me to the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in pain now?&#x201d; Fear made her voice quiver.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no pain at all. I didn&#x2019;t think I would go like this . . . or so soon. I thought I had more time, but I guess everyone thinks that.&#x201d; He closed his eyes, took another shaky breath, and called her name again.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; she answered.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be okay. You know I don&#x2019;t want to leave you all alone, but you&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;</p><p>She thought he needed her assurance. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The lockbox at the bank. The papers are there. Jared Newton, my attorney, will help you. You remember him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Please don&#x2019;t worry about me. You taught me how to take care of myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence. His grip had loosened on her hand. She watched him struggle for each breath, and she could feel the fear catching hold once more.</p><p>She thought he had fallen asleep, but suddenly he spoke again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in your name. She won&#x2019;t be able to get her hands on it.&#x201d;</p><p>What? Was he hallucinating? &#x201c;Who are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t answer her. &#x201c;When you fall in love with the right man, I won&#x2019;t get to walk you down the aisle. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about such things now, Dad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t make the same mistakes I made. Don&#x2019;t long for what you can never have. Before you know it, you will have wasted years waiting. And then it&#x2019;s too late. I should have remarried, but I couldn&#x2019;t let her go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mean Mother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said, his voice weaker now, his eyes closed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all there in the box. I waited too long.&#x201d;</p><p>His words came slowly and were whispered between labored breaths. &#x201c;When you were little I didn&#x2019;t know how to tell you. And when you grew up it didn&#x2019;t seem important. There was never the right time.&#x201d;</p><p>She softly stroked his hand. &#x201c;Tell me now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was no accident . . . Your mother didn&#x2019;t die in a car accident.&#x201d;</p><p>Cordie was confused. Why would he lie about that? They never talked about her mother, so why was he focusing on her now? &#x201c;Then how did she die?&#x201d;</p><p>His last words were faint but unmistakable. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism (Verso Classics Series)</h2><p>Walter Benjamin, one of the foremost cultural ommentators and theorists of the 20th century, is perhaps best known for his analyses of art in the modern age and the philosophy of history. Yet, it was through his study of the social and cultural history of late-19th-century Paris, examined particularly in relation to the figure of the great Parisian lyric poet Charles Baudelaire, that Benjamin tested and enriched some of his core concepts and themes. Contained within these pages are, among other insights, his notion of the &#34;flaneur&#34;, his theory of memory and remembrance, his assessment of the utopian Fourier and his reading of the modernist movement. First translated in English in 1973, this is a study of the French lyric poet Charles Baudelaire. It should be useful as a text for readers of both Benjamin and Baudelaire, and for students of French literature. Walter Benjamin is the author of &#34;One-Way Street&#34;, &#34;The Origins of German Tagic Drama&#34; and &#34;Understanding Brecht&#34;.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life</h2><p>In this book Lewis tells of his search for joy, a spiritual journey that led him from the Christianity of his early youth into atheism and then back to Christianity. This book, together with his early diary All My Road Before Me, form the closest thing we have to an autobiography.<br></p><p>&#34;A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.&#34;This book is not an autobiography. It is not a confession. It is, however, certainly one of the most beautiful and insightful accounts of a person coming to faith. In this case, that person is C.S. Lewis and his path takes us from a childhood in Belfast through the loss of his mother, to boarding school and a youthful atheism in England, to the trenches of World War I, and then to life at Oxford, where he studied, read, and, ultimately, reasoned his way back to God. It is perhaps this aspect of Surprised by Joy that we believers and nonbelievers find most compelling and meaningful; Lewis was searching for joy, for an elusive and momentary sensation of glorious yearning, but he found it, and spiritual life, through the use of reason. In this highly personal, thoughtful, intelligent memoir, Lewis guides us toward joy and toward the surprise that awaits anyone who seeks a life beyond the expected.&#34;Fascinating.&#34;--&#34;The Nation&#34;&#34;Lewis tempered his logic with a love for beauty, wonder, and magic . . . He speaks to us with all the power and life-changing force of a Plato, a Dante, and a Bunyan.&#34; &#34;Christianity Today&#34;&#34;The tension of these final chapters holds the interest like the close of a thriller God moves, indeed, in a mysterious way, and this book gives a brilliant account of one of the oddest and most decisive end-games He has ever played.&#34; &#34;Times Literary Supplement&#34; C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis (1898 1963), one of the great writers of the twentieth century, also continues to be one of our most influential Christian thinkers. He wrote more than thirty books, both popular and scholarly, including The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, The Four Loves, Mere Christianity, and Till We Have Faces.&#34;Clive Staples Lewis (29 November 1898 &#x2013; 22 November 1963), commonly referred to as C. S. Lewis and known to his friends as Jack, was a Northern Irish academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, and Christian apologist. He is also known for his fiction, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Space Trilogy. Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings. Both authors were leading figures in the English faculty at Oxford University and in the informal Oxford literary group known as the "Inklings". According to his memoir Surprised by Joy, Lewis had been baptised in the Church of Ireland at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at about the age of 30, Lewis re-converted to Christianity, becoming "a very ordinary layman of the Church of England" (Lewis 1952, p. 6). His conversion had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim. Later in his life he married the American writer Joy Gresham, who died of bone cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies over the years. The books that comprise The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, in TV, in radio, and in cinema.</p><h2>Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra and Dzogchen</h2><p>Mahamudra and Dzogchen are perhaps the most profound teachings within all of Tibetan Buddhism. The experience of <i>Mahamudra,</i> or "great symbol," is an overwhelming sense of extraordinary clarity, totally open and nondualistic. <i>Dzogchen,</i> or "great perfection," is the ultimate teaching according to the Nyingma tradition and also represents the pinnacle of spiritual development. These are the two paths that provide practitioners with the most skillful means to experience the fully awakened state and directly taste the reality of our mind and environment. And yet these concepts are notoriously difficult to grasp and challenging to explain. In <i>Wild Awakening, </i> Tibetan Buddhist master Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche presents these esoteric teachings in a style that reveals their surprising simplicity and great practical value, emphasizing that we can all experience our world more directly, with responsibility, freedom, and confidence. With a straightforward approach and informal style, he presents these essential teachings in a way that even those very new to Tibetan Buddhism can understand.</p><p>Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, born in 1965 in northeast India, was trained in the meditative and intellectual disciplines of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism under the guidance of many of the greatest masters from Tibet&#x2019;s pre-exile generation. He is a widely celebrated teacher, known for his skill in making the full richness of Buddhist wisdom accessible to modern minds, and devotes much of his energy to developing a vision of a genuine Western Buddhism.

He has studied modern psychology and has an intimate understanding of the Western mind, having lived and taught in Europe and North America for many years.

Now living in exile in Paris, he breaks his long-held silence to expose the dealings of three U.S. presidents with the Iranians as well as to describe the duplicity of Khomeini, who the author argues betrayed the spirit of the revolution. Bani-Sadr claims that the Reagan election team conspired with the Iranians to withhold the release of the hostages until after the election, thus permitting Reagan to claim the credit. He also makes some interesting comments about the involvement of Reagan and Bush in the Iran-contra arms scandal. This is a tale that is absolutely essential to read in order to appreciate contemporary Iranian politics and the 1979-80 revolution. For a wide audience.<br><i>- Sanford R.

Using new research to explore the intimate lives of novelists, poets, and critics during the Cold War, Wald reveals a radical community longing for the rebirth of the social vision of the 1930s and struggling with a loss of moral certainty as the Communist worldview was being called into question. The resulting literature, Wald shows, is a haunting record of fracture and struggle linked by common structures of feeling, ones more suggestive of the &#34;negative dialectics&#34; of Theodor Adorno than the traditional social realism of the Left. Establishing new points of contact among Kenneth Fearing, Ann Petry, Alexander Saxton, Richard Wright, Jo Sinclair, Thomas McGrath, and Carlos Bulosan, Wald argues that these writers were in dialogue with psychoanalysis, existentialism, and postwar modernism, often generating moods of piercing emot</p><p>"The work of a scholar at the height of his powers.

The classical civilizations of Greece and Rome dominated the world for centuries and continue to intrigue and enlighten us with their inventions, whether philosophy, politics, theatre, athletics, celebrity, science or the pleasures of horse racing. Robin Lane Fox's spellbinding history, spans almost a thousand years of change from the foundation of the world's first democracy in Athens to the Roman Republic and the Empire under Hadrian. Bringing great figures such as Homer, Socrates, Cicero, Alexander, Antony and Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, Augustus and the first Christian martyrs to life, exploring freedom, justice and luxury, this wonderfully exciting tour brings the turbulent histories of Greece and Rome together in a masterly study. 'Epic in the true sense'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Times Books of the Year 'He writes supremely well ... a keen eye for the telling detail and powerful example ... the humanity of the exercise shines through ... compulsory, and compulsive, reading'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Jones, Sunday Telegraph Robin Lane Fox is a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and a University Reader in Ancient History. His other books include Alexander the Great, Pagans and Christians and The Unauthorized Version. He was historical advisor to Oliver Stone on the making of Stone's film Alexander, for which he waived all his fees on condition that he could take part in the cavalry charge against elephants which Stone staged in the Moroccan desert.</p><p>Robin Lane Fox is Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, and was until 2014 Reader in Ancient History in Oxford University. He is the author of Pagans and Christians (1986), The Unauthorised Version (1992) and many books on classical history, including Alexander the Great (1973), The Classical World (2005) and Travelling Heroes (2008), all of which have been widely translated. He has been the gardening correspondent of the Financial Times since 1970.Greek and Latin may long since have lost their central place in Western education, but the influence of the classical world on our own culture remains very strong. It's there in language and law, and far more vividly present in ideas and ways of thinking about the world. Both the name and concept of democracy came from the Greeks (even if in practice ancient democracies varied massively from each other and their modern counterparts). A century ago, people were fond of comparing the British Empire to that of Rome, and nowadays it is common to look at America in the same way. The great Greek historian Thucydides would have been delighted but not surprised by such analogies; when he chronicled the struggle between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century B.C., he claimed that the events he described would be "repeated in much the same way in the future." <p>In reality, the parallels are rarely so neat, and all too often people twist the past to confirm their own preconceptions. The Nazis used the writings of Roman authors such as Tacitus to bolster their ideological claims about the inherent moral and martial superiority of the German race. That was an extreme case -- at one point, Himmler even tried to seize the oldest manuscript of one of Tacitus's books -- but even today, commentators with different political backgrounds will often draw radically opposing conclusions from the same episode in Greek or Roman history.</p><p>We need to understand the past on its own terms before trying to draw any lessons from it, and for this and other reasons, Robin Lane Fox's splendid The Classical World is to be especially welcomed. Lane Fox, who teaches at Oxford, is that rarest of writers: a distinguished academic who is willing and able to address a general audience. This latest book presents a survey of Greek and Roman culture over some 900 years, beginning with the era of Homer and ending with the rule of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. It is not a narrative history -- events such as the Peloponnesian War or Alexander the Great's campaigns are skimmed over -- but the discussion has a chronological framework, ensuring that we are not presented with a simplistic view of unchanging attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>This is a big book, but the subject is truly vast. In spite of this scope, the book's pace never slackens, and it remains readable throughout. Lane Fox makes no attempt to hide the vast gaps in our knowledge; phrases like "in my opinion" occur frequently, warning the reader that other interpretations are possible, even if there is no time to discuss them. </p><p>Evidence or lack thereof dictates what we can say about the ancient world, of course. Important figures such as the Athenian statesman Pericles remain quite shadowy, and it is very hard to gain a sense of what the great man was like. Not until the entry of King Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great, do key characters in the story register more as human beings, although the sheer scale and speed of the latter's achievements will always make him something of an enigma. This changes when we come to the centuries of Roman dominance, when the reader gets far more vivid impressions of men like Pompey and Caesar, Cicero and Pliny, Augustus and Hadrian. This is simply a reflection of the sources Lane Fox has to work with, for biographies and even private letters survive from many of these men (it is invariably a question of men since even the most influential women of the imperial court remain vaguely known figures). </p><p>Although the scope of The Classical World is broad, it deals primarily with the lives and attitudes of the wealthy elite. We know relatively little about the less well off, even in democratic Athens, and we know almost nothing about the poorer inhabitants of other Greek cities. So we do not get much sense of the lives of the majority of the population, although this would be a little more feasible in the Roman era. Three main themes of The Classical World -- justice, liberty and luxury -- are each shaped by the perspective of the upper class. For instance, Roman justice was never supposed to be blind but to take full and favorable account of a person's wealth and status. Or consider another recurring topic, the importance of horses and hunting. Few academics mention such things other than in passing, but Lane Fox -- himself an experienced equestrian and hunter -- justifiably stresses these quintessentially aristocratic concerns. </p><p>Lane Fox's survey deserves to be widely read. Indeed, I cannot think of a better introduction to the subject for those with no prior knowledge. Whether or not you agree with all his interpretations -- and many will not -- no one will doubt that these are the considered opinions of someone with a deep knowledge of the subject. (Personally, I am unconvinced that the Roman Republic "could, indeed should, have survived" Julius Caesar after he had become dictator, or that it would have survived had Mark Antony been assassinated along with Caesar.) Still, Lane Fox's strong and clear narrative will stimulate those reacquainting themselves with this fascinating era as much as it enthralls newcomers. </p><p>Reviewed by Adrian Goldsworthy <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties (2 Volumes in 1)</h2><p>Relive and thrill to the science fiction movies of the &#x2018;50s (through 1962), when jujubes and popcorn with extra butter went arm and arm with mad women (<i>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman</i>), weird teenagers (<i>I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, Teenage Zombies</i>), ill-fated matches (<i>I Married a Monster from Outer Space</i>), victims of scientific experiments (<i>The Fly</i>), and all those things that kept dropping in from outer space (<i>The Blob, The Brain Eaters</i>). As Warren meticulously and unfailingly points out, special effects were infantile (&#x201c;They fall into a huge spider web which strongly resembles a cargo net,&#x201d; <i>Earth vs. The Spider</i>), budgets incredibly small (&#x201c;As Jack Moffitt noted, &#x2018;the giant spaceman must be a fugitive from medieval France since, on his chest, he wears a shield bearing the fleur-de-lis. On his back, is an Assyrian bull, indicating he may have had his cleaning, pressing and mending done in Babylon&#x2019;,&#x201d; <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman</i>). From <i>The Astounding She-Monster</i>, another small budget reminder: &#x201c;In the first day of filming, the She-Monster bent over to kill one of the characters and ripped (her) suit in the back ... so in all subsequent scenes, the She-Monster makes exits and entrances facing the camera. Of course, this means she is walking <i>backward</i> much of the time, but aliens are weird.&#x201d; The book is filled with witty, fanatically in-depth critiques, with insider anecdotes. In addition to detailed plot synopses and production data, Warren cites good and bad reviews from the period, then adds his own analysis of how the film stands up after two or three decades. Credits add to and correct other published sources. Fantastic photographs, drawings, appendices and index are included.</p><p>Long recognized as the definitive reference work on the hundreds of science fiction movies that from 1950 through 1962 terrified and fascinated a generation with zombified teenagers, robots, invading aliens and monsters of every kind, Bill Warren&#39;s Keep Watching the Skies! is greatly expanded in this 21st Century Edition. With new entries on several films, it also revisits, revises and expands the commentary on every film in the 1982 and 1986 two-volume edition. In addition to a detailed plot synopsis, cast and credit listings, and an overview of each film&#39;s critical reception, Warren delivers richly informative assessments of the films and a wealth of insights and anecdotes about their making, often drawing on remarks by the filmmakers that have emerged in the quarter century since the original edition. The book is arranged by film title, contains 273 photographs (many rare, some in color), has seven useful appendices, and concludes with an enormous index.<b>Bill Warren</b> is a resident of Los Angeles, California.</p><h2>Barefoot Gen, Vol. 3: Life After the Bomb</h2><p>In this graphic depiction of nuclear devastation, three survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima--Gen, his mother, and his baby sister--face rejection, hunger, and humiliation in their search for a place to live</p><p>Keiji Nakazawa was six when the atomic bomb dropped on his city. His first published cartoon work appeared in 1963 and he has since has had over fifty book-length serials published. Now retired from cartooning, Nakazawa lives in Tokyo.A Note From the Author: <br><br> The atomic bomb exploded 600 meters above my hometown of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m. I was a little over a kilometer away from the epicenter, standing at the back gate of Kanzaki Primary School, when I was hit by a terrible blast of wind and searing heat. I was six years old. I owe my life to the school's concrete wall. If I hadn't been standing in its shadow, I would have been burned to death instantly by the 5,000degree heat flash. Instead, I found myself in a living hell, the details of which remain etched in my brain as if it happened yesterday. <br> My mother, Kimiyo, was eight months pregnant. She was on the second floor balcony of our house, had just finished hanging up the wash to dry, and was turning to go back inside when the bomb exploded. The blast blew the entire balcony, with my mother on it, into the alley behind our house. Miraculously, my mother survived without a scratch. <br> The blast blew our house flat. The second floor collapsed onto the first, trapping my father, my sister Eiko, and my brother Susumu under it. My brother had been sitting in the front doorway, playing with a toy ship. His head was caught under the rafter over the doorway. He frantically kicked his legs and cried out for my mother. My father, trapped inside the house, begged my mother to do something. ...</p><h2>Tales of the Old World (Warhammer Anthology)</h2><p>Repeating the winning formula established by Let the Galaxy Burn, this bumper anthology unites classic short stories with brand-new tales.

Most of the guides are devoted to a single opera, which is described in detail&#x2014;with many articles that cover its history and information about the composer and his times. The complete libretto is included in both the original language and in a modern singing translation&#x2014;except where the opera was written in English. Each has a thematic guide to the most important musical themes in musical notation and each guide is lavishly illustrated. They also contain a bibliography and a discography which is updated at each reprint. The ENO guides are widely regarded as the best series of their kind and excellent value.&nbsp;It used to be thought that Verdi miscalculated with this attempt at a 'grand opera' in the French style. This Opera Guide presents the evidence that <i>Don Carlos</i> was&#x2014;and remains&#x2014;an extraordinary achievement in melding two opposing visions of opera: the spectacular public aspect of the French tradition with the dramatic concision of the Italian.

"Jess?" There was no response from his daughter, but Ash and Luna, his two Siberian huskies, bounded out of the living room. Cursing under his breath, he watched in exasperation as both dogs cannoned toward him. <em>"Jess?</em> You left the door to the living room open again. The dogs aren't supposed to be in there. Come down here right now and pick up your coat and boots! Do not jump up&#x2014;<em>I'm warning you</em>&#x2014;" He braced himself as Ash sprang. "Why does no one listen to me around here?"<br><br>Luna, the more gentle of the two dogs, put her paws on his chest and tried to lick his face.<br><br>"Nice to know my word is law." But Tyler rubbed her ears gently, burying his fingers in her thick fur as Jess emerged from the kitchen, a piece of toast in one hand and her phone in the other, head nodding in time to music as she pushed headphones away from her ears. She was wearing one of his sweaters, and the gold medal he'd won for the downhill dangled around her neck.<br><br>"Hi, Dad. How was your day?"<br><br>"I made it through alive until I stepped through my own front door. I've skied off cliffs safer than our hallway." Glowering at her, Tyler pushed the ecstatic dogs away and nudged the abandoned snow boots to one side with his foot. "Pick those up. And leave your boots on the porch from now on. You shouldn't be wearing them indoors."<br><br>Still chewing, Jess stared at his feet. "You're wearing your boots indoors."<br><br>Not for the first time, Tyler reflected on the challenges of parenting. "New rule. I'll leave mine outside, too. That way we don't get snow in the house. And hang your coat up instead of dropping it over any convenient surface."<br><br>"You drop yours."<br><br><em>Holy hell.</em> "I'm hanging it up. Watch me." He shrugged out of his jacket and hung it up with exaggerated purpose. "And turn the music down. That way you'll be able to hear me when I'm yelling at you."<br><br>She grinned, unabashed. "I turn it up so I can't hear you yelling at me. Grandma just sent me a text all in capitals. You need to teach her how to use her phone."<br><br>"You're the teenager. You teach her."<br><br>"She texted me in capitals all last week, and the week before that she kept dialing Uncle Jackson by accident."<br><br>Tyler, entertained by the thought of his business-focused brother being driven insane by calls from their mother in the middle of his working day, grinned back. "I bet he loved that. So what did she want?"<br><br>"She was inviting me to come over when you're at the team meeting at the Outdoor Center. I'm going to help her cook." She took another bite of toast. "It's family night tonight. Everyone is coming, even Uncle Sean. Had you forgotten?"<br><br>Tyler groaned. "Team meeting and Fright Night? Whose idea was that?"<br><br>"Grandma's. She worries about me, because I live with you, and the only thing that never runs out in our fridge is beer. And you're not supposed to call it Fright Night. Can I come to the team meeting?"<br><br>"You would hate every moment."<br><br>"I wouldn't! I love being part of a family business. The way you feel about meetings is the way I feel about school. Being trapped indoors is a waste of time when there's all that snow out there. But at least you get to ski all day. I'm stuck to a hard chair trying to understand math. Pity me." She finished the toast, and Tyler frowned as crumbs fell on the floor.<br><br>Ash pounced on them with enthusiasm.<br><br>"You're the reason the fridge is empty. You're always eating. If I'd known you were going to eat this much, I never would have let you live with me. You're costing me a fortune."<br><br>The fact his joke made her laugh told him how far they'd come in the year they'd been living together.<br><br>"Grandma says if I wasn't living with you, you'd drown in your own mess."<br><br>"You're the one dropping the crumbs. You should use a plate."<br><br>"You never use a plate. You're always dropping crumbs on the floor."<br><br>"You don't have to do everything I do."<br><br>"You're the grown-up. I'm following your example."<br><br>The thought was enough to bring him out in a cold sweat. "Don't. You should do the opposite of everything I have ever done." He watched as Jess bent to make a fuss of Luna, and the medal around her neck swung forward, almost hitting the dog on the nose. "Why are you wearing that?"<br><br>"It motivates me. And I like the example you set. You're the coolest dad on the planet. And you're fun to live with. Especially when you're trying to behave."<br><br>"Trying to&#x2014;" Tyler dragged his gaze from the medal that was a painful reminder of his old life. "What's that supposed to mean?"<br><br>"I mean I like living here. You don't worry about the same stuff as most grown-ups."<br><br>"I'm probably supposed to." Tyler ran his hand over the back of his neck. "I have a new respect for your grandmother. How did Mom raise three boys without strangling us?"<br><br>"Grandma would never strangle anyone. She's patient and kind."<br><br>"Yeah, right. Unfortunately for you, I'm not, and I'm the one raising you now." The reality of that still terrified him more than anything he'd faced on the downhill ski circuit. If he messed this up, the consequences would be worse than a damaged leg and a shattered career. "So have you finished your assignment?"<br><br>"No. I started, but I got distracted watching the recording of your downhill in Beaver Creek. Come and watch it with me."<br><br>He'd rather poke himself in the eye with a ski pole.<br><br>"Maybe later. I had a call from your teacher." Casually, he changed the subject. "You didn't hand in your assignment on Monday."<br><br>"Luna ate it."<br><br>"Sure she did. You are allowed one late assignment in each trimester. You've already had two."<br><br>"Weren't you ever late handing in assignments?"<br><br><em>All the time.</em><br><br>Wondering why anyone would choose to have more than one kid when being a parent was this hard, Tyler tried a different approach. "If you have five late assignments, you'll be staying late at homework club. That cuts into your skiing time."<br><br>That wiped the smile from her face. "I'll get it done."<br><br>"Good decision. And next time, finish your homework before you watch TV."<br><br>"I wasn't watching TV. I was watching you. I want to understand your technique. You were the best. I'm going to ski every spare minute this winter." She closed her hand around the medal, making it sound like a vow. "Will you be at race training tomorrow? You said you'd try to be there."<br><br>Floored by that undiluted adoration, Tyler looked into his daughter's eyes and saw the same passion that burned in his own.<br><br>He thought of all the jobs that were piling up at Snow Crystal. Jobs that needed his attention. Then he thought about the years he'd missed out on being with his daughter. "I'll be there." He strolled through to his recently renovated kitchen, cursing under his breath as cold seeped through his socks. "Jess, you've been dripping snow through the whole house. It's like wading through a river."<br><br>"That was Luna. She rolled in a snowdrift and then shook herself."<br><br>"Next time she can shake herself outside our house."<br><br>"I didn't want her to get cold." Watching him, Jess pushed her hair behind her ear. "You called it <em>our</em> house."<br><br>"She's a dog, Jess! She has thick fur. She doesn't get cold. And of course I called it <em>our</em> house. What else would I call it? We both live here, and right now there's no chance of me forgetting that!" He stepped over another patch of water. "I've spent the past couple of years renovating this place, and I still feel as if I need to wear my boots indoors."<br><br>"I love Ash and Luna. They're family. I never had a dog in Chicago. Mom hated mess. We never had a real Christmas tree, either. She hated those because she had to pick up the needles."<br><br>Tension and irritation fled. The mention of Jess's mother made Tyler feel as if someone had stuffed snow down his neck. Suddenly, it wasn't only his feet that were cold.<br><br>He clamped his mouth down on the comment that wanted to leave his lips. The truth was that Janet Carpenter had hated just about everything. She'd hated Vermont, she'd hated living so far from a city, she'd hated skiing. Most of all, she'd hated him. But his family had made it a rule not to say a bad word about Janet in front of Jess, and he stuck to that rule even when the strain of it brought him close to bursting. "We'll have a real tree this year. We'll take a trip into the forest and choose one together." Aware that he might be overcompensating, he reverted back to his normal self. "And I'm glad you love the dogs, but that doesn't change the fact you should keep the damn living room door closed when they're in the house. This place is no longer a construction site. The new rule is no dogs on sofas or on beds."<br><br>"I think Luna prefers the old rules." Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "And you're not supposed to say damn. Grams hates it when you swear."<br><br>Tyler kept his jaw tightened. "Well, Grams isn't here, is she?" His grandmother and grandfather still lived at the resort, in the converted sugarhouse that had once been the hub of Snow Crystal's maple syrup production. "And if you tell her, I'll throw you on your butt in the snow, and you'll be wetter than Luna. Now go and finish your assignment or I'll get the bad parent award, and I'm not prepared to climb onto the podium to collect that one."<br><br>Jess beamed. "If I promise to hand in my assignment and not tell anyone you swear, can we watch skiing together in your den later?"<br><br>"You should ask Brenna. She's a gifted teacher." He was about to reach for a beer when he remembered he was supposed to be setting an example, so poured himself a glass of milk instead. Since Jess had moved in, he'd disciplined himself not to drink from the carton. "She'll tell you what everyone is doing wrong."<br><br>"She's already promised to help me now I've made the school ski team. Have you seen her in the gym? She has sick abs."<br><br>"Yeah, I've seen her." And he didn't let himself think about her abs.<br><br>He didn't let himself think about any part of her.<br><br>She was his best friend, and she was staying that way.<br><br>To take his mind off the thought of Brenna's abs, he stuck his head back in the fridge. "This fridge is empty."<br><br>"Kayla's giving me a lift into the village later so I'll pick something up." Her phone beeped, and she dug it out of her pocket. "Oh&#x2014;"<br><br>Tyler pushed the door shut with his shoulder and then caught sight of her expression. "What's wrong?"<br><br>"Kayla texted to say she's tied up with work, that's all."<br><br>"Sounds painful. Never mind. I'll go to the store tomorrow."<br><br>Jess stared at her phone. "I need to go now."<br><br>"Why? We both hate shopping. It can wait."<br><br>"This can't wait." Her head was down, but he saw color streak across her cheekbones.<br><br>"Is this about Christmas? Because it's not for another couple of weeks. We still have plenty of time. Most of my shopping gets done at three o'clock on Christmas Eve."<br><br>"It's not about Christmas! Dad, I need&#x2014;" she broke off, her face scarlet "&#x2014;some things from the store, that's all."<br><br>"What can you possibly need that can't wait until tomorrow?"<br><br>"Girl stuff, okay? I need girl stuff!" Snapping at him, she spun on her heel and stalked out of the room leaving Tyler staring after her, trying to understand the reason for the sudden mood explosion.<br><br>Girl stuff?<br><br>It took him a moment, and then he closed his eyes briefly and swore under his breath.<br><br><em>Girl stuff.</em><br><br>Comprehension came along with a moment of pure panic. Nothing in his past life had prepared him to raise a teenager. Especially not a teenage girl.<br><br>When had she&#x2014;?<br><br>He glanced toward the door, knowing he had to say something, but clueless as to the most sensitive way to broach a topic that embarrassed the hell out of both of them.<br><br>Could he ignore it?<br><br>Tell her to search the internet?<br><br>He ran his hand over his face and cursed under his breath, knowing he couldn't ignore it or leave something that important to a search engine.<br><br>It wasn't as if she had her mother to ask. He was the only parent in her life. And right now she was probably thinking that was a raw deal.<br><br>"Jess!" He yelled after her, and when there was no response, he strode out of the kitchen and found her tugging her boots on in the hall. "Get in the car. I'll take you to the store."<br><br>"Forget it." Her voice was muffled, her hair falling forward over her face. "I'm going to walk over to the house and ask Grandma to drive me."<br><br>"Grandma hates driving in the snow and the dark. I'll take you." His voice was rougher than he intended, and he stretched out a hand to touch her shoulder and then pulled it back. To hug or not to hug? He had no idea. "I was going to the store anyway."<br><br>"You were going tomorrow, not today."<br><br>"Well, now I'm going today." He grabbed his coat. "Come on. We'll pick up some of that chocolate you like."<br><br>Still not looking at him, she fiddled with her boots, and he sighed, wishing for the hundredth time that teenage girls came with an operating manual.<br><br>"Jess, it's all good."<br><br>"It's not good," she muttered in a strangled tone, "it's like a <em>massive</em> avalanche of awkward! You're thinking this is your worst nightmare."<br><br>"I'm not thinking that." He gripped the door handle. "I'm thinking I'm messing it up. I'm saying the wrong things and making you feel uncomfortable, which is not my intention."<br><br>She peeped at him through her hair. "You're wishing I'd never come to live here."<br><br>He'd thought they'd got past that. The insecurity.<br><br>Those creeping, confidenceeroding doubts that had eaten away at her happiness. "I'm not wishing that."<br><br>"Mom told me she wished I'd never been born."<br><br>Tyler zipped up his jacket viciously, almost removing a finger in the process. "She didn't mean that." He dragged open the door, grateful for the blast of freezing air to cool his temper.<br><br>"Yes, she did." Jess mumbled the words. "She told me I was the worst thing that ever happened to her."<br><br>"Well, I've never thought that. Not once.

He has won both the Nebula and Hugo awards for his work.Imitative 23rd-century lunar ruling-computer-goes-mad yarn from the author of, most recently, Blue Champagne (1986). Two centuries after plot-device-only aliens invade and occupy Earth, the self-contained colony of Juna is run by the omnipresent Central Computer; its inhabitants enjoy a worry-free, want-free environment of perfect health and longevity. Hildy Johnson is a top reporter for (the equivalent of) a leading tabloid newspaper; what he doesn't know is why he keeps trying to kill himself. The CC prepares a series of artificial memories designed to explore Hildy's problem; but gradually Hildy learns that the CC itself has suicidal impulses (it's been forced to destroy several of its own subsystems). Indeed, the CC's problem may be causing Hildy's! Following a sex change, Hildy discovers that a crashed and apparently abandoned prototype starship actually contains a thriving colony of dissenters; they have made some startling scientific discoveries but fear becoming controlled by the CC, whose actions are growing ever more bizarre and dangerous. Though initially suspicious, ``Heinleiners'' come to trust Hildy, and explain their program (genetic research, interstellar flight, etc.). But then the CC--now insane, with ``good'' and ``evil'' aspects in conflict--attacks, intending to capture or kill Hildy. Hildy escapes, barely, while the CC is put out of action, and the child that Hildy has just given birth to dies. Sort of a Great Heinlein Memorial Novel--tediously so at times--hardworking and with flashes of wit, but weighed down with expository chat, a thin and contrived plot, and poorly defined characters. Once a prodigious talent, Varley has subsided into an overblown, obfuscatory mode that will disappoint all but his most ardent fans. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

No goal is more elusive. In <i>How to Be a Stoic</i>, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us--and<i> How to Be a Stoic</i> is the essential guide.<br></p><p><b>Massimo Pigliucci</b> is the K.D. Irani Professor of Philosophy at the City College of New York. He holds PhDs in genetics, evolutionary biology, and philosophy. He has written for many outlets, including the <i>New York Times</i>, and has written or edited ten books. He lives in New York, New York."<i>How to Be a Stoic</i> is highly readable, written in clear and accessible prose, and illuminated with anecdotes of both a personal and an historical nature."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>How to Be a Stoic</i> proves many things: that the ancient school of Stoicism is superbly relevant to our times; that profound wisdom can be delivered in lively, breezy prose; and that Massimo Pigliucci is uniquely gifted at translating philosophy into terms helpful for alleviating and elevating the lives of many."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of <i>Plato at the Googleplex</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this thought-provoking book, Massimo Pigliucci shares his journey of discovering the power of Stoic practices in a philosophical dialogue with one of Stoicism's greatest teachers."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ryan Holiday, bestselling author of <i>The Obstacle is the Way </i>and <i>The Daily Stoic</i></b></i></b><br><br>"As its title suggests, <i>How to Be a Stoic</i> is a how-to book, but one of a very high order. Yes, Massimo Pigliucci gives his readers advice on how to live a happy and meaningful life. He is careful, though, to put a secure foundation under that advice by explaining who the ancient Stoics were and how they arrived at the conclusions they did. Do you want to avoid wasting the one life you have to live? Read this book!"&#x2015;<b><i><b>William B. Irvine, author of <i>A Guide to the Good Life </i></b></i></b><br><br>"If you want to want to learn the ways of Stoicism, and you're living in the 21st century, this should be one of the first books you read. Massimo has written a fine primer for the aspiring Marcus Aurelius."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Donald J. Robertson, author of <i>The Philosophy of CBT </i>and <i>Stoicism and the Art of Happiness</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This is a lucid, engaging, and persuasive book about what it means to pursue Stoic ideals in the here and now. Massimo Pigliucci's imaginary conversations with Epictetus carry the reader effortlessly along while grounding the discussion firmly in the ancient Stoic tradition--and in his own life experience. The result is a compelling picture of a Stoic way of life that is consistent with contemporary science and philosophy, and is both eminently ethical and down-to-earth practical. It will be inviting to Stoics and non-Stoics alike who are willing to reason together seriously about how (and why) to be a modern Stoic."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Lawrence C.

Son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister, Henry Tanner (1859-1937) trained under Thomas Eakins in Philadelphia, then left his native U.S. in 1891 for Paris; a proud, quiet individualist determined to surmount racism, he would spent most of his life in France, serving as a beacon to the Harlem Renaissance. Tanner's sensitive, naturalistic animal studies, modernized reinterpretations of biblical themes, subdued yet powerful WW I scenes and brooding, mystical oriental pictures had an impact that was "by no means race-bound"; his continual experimentation with techniques likewise influenced many artists. Tanner's marvelous visionary paintings of the late 1920s and early '30s are full of foreboding of a world on the brink of self-destruction. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Scion of a distinguished African American family, Tanner achieved international fame as a painter of genre and religious scenes in the first decades of this century only to lapse into obscurity in self-imposed exile in France. His resurrection and reappraisal, begun in the 1960s, will be greatly aided by this well-illustrated and scholarly catalog of the current nationally traveling retrospective. By virtue of its integration of biography and art criticism with 105 color and 94 black-and-white illustrations, this book is the preeminent work on Tanner.

Now, for the first time, the head of a mob family has granted complete and total access to a journalist. Casso has given <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Philip Carlo the most intimate, personal look into the world of La Cosa Nostra ever seen. This is his shocking story.</p><p>From birth, Anthony Casso's mob life was preordained. Michael Casso introduced his young son around South Brooklyn's social clubs, where "men of honor" did business by shaking pinkie-ringed hands&#x2014;hands equally at home pilfering stolen goods from the Brooklyn docks or gripping the cold steel of a silenced pistol. Young Anthony watched and listened and decided that he would devote his life to crime.</p><p>Casso would prove his talent for "earning," concocting ingenious schemes to hijack trucks, rob banks, and bring into New York vast quantities of cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. Casso also had an uncanny ability to work with the other Mafia families, and he forged unusually strong ties with the Russian mob. By the time Casso took the reins of the Lucchese family, he was a seasoned boss, a very dangerous man.</p><p>It was a great life&#x2014;Casso and his beautiful wife, Lillian, had money to burn; Casso and his crew brought in so much cash that he had dozens of large safe-deposit boxes filled with bricks of hundred-dollar bills. But the law finally caught up with him in his New Jersey safe house in 1994. Rather than stoically face the music like the old-time mafiosi he revered, Casso became the thing he most hated&#x2014;a rat. It broke his family's heart and made the once feared and revered mobster an object of scorn and disgust among his former friends. For it turned out that a lifetime of street smarts completely failed him in dealing with a group even more cunning and ruthless than the Mafia&#x2014;the U.S. government.</p><p>Detailing Casso's feud with John Gotti and their attempts to kill each other, the "Windows Case" that led to the beginning of the end for the mob in New York, and Casso's dealings with decorated NYPD officers Lou Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa&#x2014;the "Mafia cops"&#x2014;<em>Gaspipe</em> is the inside story of one man's rise and fall, mirroring the rise and fall of a way of life, a roller-coaster ride into a netherworld few outsiders have ever dared to enter.</p></p><p><p>Philip Carlo was born and raised on the mean streets of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn&#x2014;the same streets Tommy Pitera hailed from. There, Carlo earned a Ph.D. in street smarts, and he escaped a life of crime by writing about it with unusual insight. He is the author of the bestsellers <em>The Night Stalker</em>, about notorious serial killer Richard Ramirez, and <em>The Ice Man</em>, about infamous Mafia contract killer Richard Kuklinski. Carlo lives with his wife, Laura, in New York City.</p>If you&#39;d like to vicariously observe contract killings, lucrative robberies, and meetings with Mafia bosses, you&#39;ve found the right audiobook. Now in prison, Cosa Nostra boss Antonio Casso tells all to the author in a blatant violation of OMERT--the code of silence. His double life of loving family man and relentless killer hardly seems possible--unless you&#39;re familiar with Tony Soprano. Alan Sklar&#39;s deep, raspy voice fits the noir tale of violence and death. His delivery stays matter-of-fact and detached while describing dozens of assassinations, often preceded by torture. When necessary, Sklar&#39;s Italian kicks in so well one can almost see his arms waving.

In the late eighteenth century the person most responsible for this was Warren Hastings, Britain's first governor-general of India. In <i>Dawning of the Raj</i>, Jeremy Bernstein brings to life in vivid colors Hastings's story amidst the rise of British power. Orphaned early, Hastings worked his way up from the lowest clerk in the East India Company to its highest office in India. His concern for native cultures led him to sponsor the first British expedition to Tibet and the first translation into English of the Bhagavadgita. Brilliant and autocratic, he also made enemies, and upon his return to England they charged him with "high crimes and misdemeanors." His impeachment trial, one of the great spectacles of the age, lasted seven years and pitted Hastings against the likes of Edmund Burke and the playwright Richard Sheridan. It attracted the novelist Fanny Burney, who wrote of it with passion in her Journals. This parliamentary drama, replete with the trappings of state, forms the conclusion to Mr. Bernstein's fascinating, unusual, and completely captivating narrative. With 22 black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>This historical adventure story of the first order chronicles the life of Warren Hastings, who planted the roots of the British Empire in India.

Case, a North Carolina lawyer and politician, soon finds himself propelled into the middle of Washington politics in an effort to help reshape twisted lives and challenge corrupt systems</p><p>A native North Carolinian who now lives abroad, <b>T. Davis Bunn</b> was recognized internationally as a consultant, lecturer, and speaker in the area of international finance and received invitations to address symposiums, conferences, and management meetings. His professional interests took a decided turn nearly eighteen years ago. Although he continued his career in international finance, he became a "closet" novelist. For nine years, he wrote with discipline and drive, never to have anything published. When one of his novels came to the attention of Bethany House Publishers, his status as an unpublished novelist changed. His first book, <i>The Presence, </i>was published in 1990 and quickly became a bestseller.<p></p> <p>A prolific writer, he now has over twenty books in publication, including three with Janette Oke, a wonderful children's picture book called <i>Princess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat</i>, the heartwarming gift book <i>The Quilt,</i> and his latest, <i>The Dream Voyagers,</i> originally published under the pen name Thomas Locke.</p> <p>"The novels I've had published by Bethany House are the direction I hope my future writing will take--captivating stories of intrigue, drama and faith, with compelling characters in an enjoyable contemporary fictional setting," says Bunn. "The emotional bonding that occurs with the reader in good fiction often gives the Christian message more direct meaning in the reader's life."</p> <p>Prior to his work in international finance, Davis completed studies in psychology and economics at Wake Forest University. Fluent in three languages, he has traveled extensively in more than forty countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Davis has also avocationally become a serious student of comparative religion, learning from Jewish rabbis, Buddhist monks, Muslim imams, Catholic priests, and Baptist ministers. Drawing on these experiences, Davis fills his books with colorful dialogue and richly textured settings. </p> size : 5.3 x 8.3</p><h2>Native Guard, Poems</h2><p>Winner of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for poetry, Natasha Trethewey&#x2019;s elegiac Native Guard is a deeply personal volume that brings together two legacies of the Deep South.<br><br>The title of the collection refers to the Mississippi Native Guards, a black regiment whose role in the Civil War has been largely overlooked by history. As a child in Gulfport, Mississippi, in the 1960s, Trethewey could gaze across the water to the fort on Ship Island where Confederate captives once were guarded by black soldiers serving the Union cause. The racial legacy of the South touched Trethewey&#x2019;s life on a much more immediate level, too. Many of the poems in Native Guard pay loving tribute to her mother, whose marriage to a white man was illegal in her native Mississippi in the 1960s. Years after her mother&#x2019;s tragic death, Trethewey reclaims her memory, just as she reclaims the voices of the black soldiers whose service has been all but forgotten.<br><br>Included in this beautiful new edition of Native Guard is an audio CD of the poems read by the author -- a lovely gift for anyone who loves poetry that speaks to the heart and mind.</p><p>NATASHA TRETHEWEY is the current U.S. Poet Laureate and is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of English and Creative Writing at Emory University.<i>Native Guard</i>, her third collection of poetry, received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize.<i>Beyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast</i> was published in 2010. A new collection of poetry,<i>Thrall</i>, is forthcoming in September.The frontispiece of Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard informs me she was born in Gulfport, Miss., that her mother was black and her father white. Reasonable deduction (assuming the "I" of the poems is the poet) tells me that, in her formative years, issues pertaining to her biracial heritage were exacerbated by Mississippi's legacy of oppression -- its dark, buried history. In a region struggling to confront its past, how was a young poet supposed to learn to accept who she was?<p> Trethewey's personal dilemma must have been awkward, full of tangled emotions and memorable embarrassments. It's the kind of background that has humbled many people into silence. And yet, for the purposes of literature, aren't these kinds of growing pains priceless? We should probably envy this poet's peculiar destiny. Not only has Trethewey chosen speech rather than silence, she has chosen to express herself in verse. Given her material, she could easily write essays or a memoir. But she has a genuine gift for verse forms, and the depth of her engagement in language marks her as a true poet. </p><p> In Native Guard, Trethewey traces the buried history of the South to the point where her personal narrative begins. "In 1965, my parents broke two laws of Mississippi;/ they went to Ohio to marry, returned to Mississippi," begins a ghazal (a poem in two-line stanzas linked by a rhyme scheme) titled "Miscegenation." "My Mother Dreams of Another Country" jumps ahead to Trethewey's birth year and depicts her mother's distress: "This is 1966 -- she is married to a white man -- / and there are more names for what grows inside her./ It is enough to worry about words like mongrel/ and the infertility of mules and mulattoes."</p><p> The title poem is a 10-sonnet sequence in which the last line of each sonnet becomes a variant of the subsequent sonnet's opening line, creating a lovely, wreathlike effect. The graceful form conceals a gritty subject. "Native Guard" is a first-person narrative of an unnamed ex-slave who has joined the Union army to serve in an all-black regiment. The lines have a stately, chiming perfection. The circular form mirrors the bizarre circularity of circumstance that finds the narrator -- once a slave -- now guarding Confederates who have been captured and imprisoned inside the Union fort at Ship Island, Miss. The narrator compares his life in bondage to his life as a military officer, guarding the fallen rebels: </p><p>I now use ink to keep record, a closed book, not the lure of memory -- flawed, changeful -- that dulls the lash for the master, sharpens it for the slave.</p><p>For the slave, having a master sharpens the bend into work, the way the sergeant moves us now to perfect battalion drill, dress parade.</p><p> Trethewey doesn't try to reproduce the way this character would actually speak. Whereas many poets would have spiced his monologue with dialect, she doesn't. Though a former slave, he is literate; he writes letters for his fellow soldiers. "I listen, put down in ink what I know/ they labor to say between silences." Trethewey gives her narrator a literary voice -- the voice of a 19th-century writer practiced in the diction and oratory of his time, of Frederick Douglass's masterful autobiographies, a voice that echoes the rhythms of great Western poetry. </p><p> Trethewey has a gift for squeezing the contradictions of the South into very tightly controlled lines. A certain staid, formal approach is both her strength and the only possible grounds I have to criticize her poetry. Native Guard is a small book, containing mostly short poems, a few of which read like exercises. When poets find their voices, form and content intermesh seamlessly. One can still see Trethewey's technique and feel the influence of poetry workshops. One feels a bit let down when a poem sets up an interesting emotional crisis, then resolves it almost too quickly. One feels at times as though her poems are succinct for the sake of making them work, rather than fulfilling either the poet's memory of her experience or the reader's heightened expectations. </p><p> Trethewey's style is reserved, even cautious, though her subjects are emotionally charged, even violent. This creates an interesting dichotomy, especially in poems such as "Pastoral" with its touchy image of Trethewey confronting the great white Southern poets -- Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren and others -- while in blackface. Though this is her third book, Trethewey is still perfecting her voice and may have only scratched the surface of her remarkable talent. </p><p>Reviewed by Darryl Lorenzo Wellington <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Detailed yet succinct, the very readable articles are collected under seven topics?e.g, the cosmos, the ground and the underground?and arranged alphabetically by subject. The diverse coverage examines myriad imagined powers and creatures from historical, sociological, cultural, and artistic perspectives, and while many of the ghosts, wizards, gremlins, gods, fairies, and so forth are familiar, many more, e.g., Hyperborea, Alulei, and Phaeton, are not. Each article summarizes the identity, definition, and aspects of the entity, drawing on material derived from classic studies in myth and lore. The illustrations are extraordinary. Though the format is somewhat ungainly for a reference source, and cross references are absent, this book is a rich treasury. The Australian authors, who have written several monographs on mysteries, gnomes, and weird tales of land and sea, have demonstrated a remarkable grasp of the narrative elements of folklore, fables, and belief systems.

According to twelve-year-old Luke Tripp, the killer was a cape-clad highwayman atop a black stallion. <br><br>As implausible as the boy&#x2019;s story sounds, Bryant and May take it seriously when &#x201c;The Highwayman&#x201d; is spotted again, striking a dramatic pose at the scene of his next outlandish murder.

To do it, they&#x2019;re going to have to use every orthodox&#x2013;and unorthodox&#x2013;means at their disposal, including myth, witchcraft, and the psychogeographic history of the city&#x2019;s &#x201c;monsters,&#x201d; past and present.<br><br>And if one unsolvable crime weren&#x2019;t enough, this case has disturbing links to a decades-old killing spree that nearly destroyed the partnership of Bryant and May once before...and may again.

While I am loath to commit myself in writing over such a delicate matter, and dislike 'telling tales' on staff members despite their extreme lack of co-operation over the last few months, I feel the time has come to unburden myself to someone in a position of greater authority. In short, Mr Faraday, I can no longer maintain my silence. I have simply reached the end of my tether. <br><br>I appreciate that, as the 'new broom' at HO Special Services Liaison, taking over from HMCO Liaison DCI Stanley Marsden, you must have a great deal of background material to study. I shall therefore attempt to save you some work by summarising our current situation.<br><br>The Peculiar Crimes Unit was founded, along with a handful of other specialist departments, soon after the outbreak of World War II, as part of a government initiative to ease the burden on London's overstretched Metropolitan Police Force, by tackling high-profile cases which had the capacity to compound social problems in urban areas. The crimes falling within its remit were often of a politically sensitive nature, or could potentially cause social panics and general public malaise. The division's civilian counterpart at that time was the Central Therapy Unit, set up to help the bereaved and the homeless cope with the psychological stress of war. This unit closed after just eleven months because bombed-out residents continued turning to their neighbours for support rather than visiting qualified specialists. There was also, if memory serves, an experimental propaganda division called the Central Information Service (later to become the COI), which provided positive, uplifting news items to national newspapers in order to combat hearsay and harmful disinformation spread about our overseas forces, and to fill the void left by the blanket news blackouts. The PCU proved more successful than either of these, and remained in operation through the war.<br><br>I am led to believe that the title 'peculiar' was originally meant in the sense of 'particular,' as the government's plan was that the new unit should handle those cases deemed uniquely sensitive and a high risk to public morale. To head this division, several extremely young and inexperienced students were recruited. One must remember that this was a time of desperation, when most able-bodied men had been taken into the armed forces, and a great many experimental ideas were proposed by the Churchill government.<br><br>A number of successful prosecutions were brought by the Peculiar Crimes Unit in the years that followed, with the result that the unit continued its work into peacetime. The rebuilding of Britain required the suppression of those prosecutions deemed too negative for public knowledge (a fifty-year embargo being placed on sensitive war reports), and many cases handled by the PCU at this time remained <i>sub judice</i>. <br><br>In order to provide continuity, the sons and daughters of original staff members were recruited, so that the founding team was largely replaced with new employees, but two gentlemen remained in their old positions. I refer, of course, to Mr Arthur Bryant and Mr John May (see attached file 3458SD). This is where the problem starts, for both of them, despite their advanced age, are still here at the unit. They stayed on because the unit granted them a high degree of autonomy, and their specialist knowledge, plus their refusal to accept promotion, continuing instead to tackle crime at street level, won them the allegiance of young incoming staff in the Metropolitan Police Force. In years to come, as their supporters moved to positions of power, these loyalties proved useful to the detectives.<br><br>I know that the PCU has lately had some success in solving crimes that have come to the attention of the general public. I am also aware that its most senior detectives are highly respected and can offer an enormous amount of experience between them, but their manner is disruptive and their behaviour--certainly in terms of efficient, modern crime management--is unorthodox, and damaging to the image of the national policing network. <br><br>Their long-running investigation into the murders of young women committed by the so-called Leicester Square Vampire, last sighted in 1975, brought the PCU into disrepute. Their working practises proved questionable, and the case remains unsolved to this day. The unit's brief is admittedly unusual; their cases rarely provide the opportunity to follow direct leads and name suspects, but their methodology is regarded as altogether too vague, intellectual, socialist, and downright arty by those who work on the 'coal face' of crime, an image the detectives have sought to foster rather than disabuse. <br><br>Heaven knows I am no intellectual, but even I can tell that these gentlemen would be better employed as academics than as police officers. Mr May once told me that he could be loosely termed a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the rational progressive who sometimes placed feeling over reason, but Mr Bryant's philosophical attitude towards criminal investigation is more complex and troubling; although enlightened and well-read, a 'cold fish' who rarely empathises with victims of crime, he is quite prepared to resort to the kind of Counter-Enlightenment mysticism that allows some rationalists to believe in ley lines and crystal healing when it suits them. Simply stated, Mr Bryant and Mr May are completely out of touch with the problems of today's youth. Elderly people rarely commit crimes; how can Mr Bryant and Mr May possibly hope to understand what is happening on the streets of London anymore?<br><br>The general public must be able to feel that their lives are in safe hands. As you know, not long ago Mr Bryant accidentally blew up his own unit. Subsequently he managed to get himself shut in a sewer, and nearly died. His partner has had one heart attack, and flagrantly defies doctor's orders to lead a less stressful working life. Nor does Mr May help our image by conducting a very public affair with a married woman. The pair keep irregular hours, behave and dress oddly, and encourage everyone else in their employ to do the same. Detective Sergeant Janice Longbright seems to model herself on Diana Dors, the fifties Rank starlet, and comes to work in the most extraordinarily provocative outfits. I sometimes wonder if we're running a police unit or an escort agency.<br><br>Neither Mr Bryant nor Mr May believes in traditional hierarchy. They speak to their colleagues as equals, and frequently ask advice from the most inexperienced members of staff. Obviously, this will not do. Mr Bryant took his exams a very long time ago, and is unwilling to entertain the idea of modern police procedure. He's always touching things; it's only luck that prevents half his cases from being thrown out of court due to cross-contamination of evidence. The criminal world has altered drastically since his time. Even constables are required to pass exams in criminal law, traffic law, and general police duties, but Mr Bryant has somehow been granted immunity from evaluation tests. He has repeatedly refused to take his Objective Structured Performance Related Examination, and deliberately falsifies results from his continuous appraisals.<br><br>Of course, the national police force now operates under a regime of openness and transparency, but Mr Bryant prefers to keep his superiors in the dark because, he says, 'it is simpler for them to understand nothing.'<br><br>As you know, my own background is in forensic sciences. When I sought promotion to a more senior decision-making role, I was brought into this unit as Acting Temporary Head. As the title implies, I did not expect to remain in the position for more than three months.<br><br>That was in 1973. I am still here, still awaiting a transfer.<br><br>By the time I joined, the Peculiar Crimes Unit had become very peculiar indeed. It could be likened to a doctors' surgery that had abandoned traditional pharmaceutical treatments for alternative therapies. Over time, these therapies have become more extreme; we have reached a point when it seems quite normal for Mr Bryant to ignore empirical data in favour of hiring a clairvoyant in the search for a missing person. Mr May is not much better; his investigation into pagan elementals a few months ago did result in the capture of a wanted criminal, but he still destroyed a section of the Regent Canal in the process, and the case appears to have involved a mass breakout of illegal immigrants from King's Cross, whom both he and his partner aided and abetted. <br><br>The bizarre behaviour of these geriatric detectives seems to infect those working around them, so that I am made to seem the 'odd man out.' I am openly ridiculed and humiliated. Mr Bryant's experiments, conducted without any safety precautions, are both questionable and dangerous. My instructions are disobeyed, my reputation has been irreversibly damaged, and my office wallpaper has been ruined.<br><br>Both Mr Bryant and Mr May are beyond statutory retirement age and show no inclination to leave. No-one seems to know quite how old they are, as their files were apparently lost in the fire that destroyed their old offices, but I am reliably informed that Mr Bryant is three years older than his counterpart. Mr May is certainly the more amenable of the pair, possessing a more youthful outlook. He is at least partially familiar with technological advances in the field of crime detection, but Mr Bryant is quite impossible to deal with. In the last eighteen months he ha...</p><h2>Demon Rumm</h2><p>It was the publicity stunt from hell as far as Kirsten Rumm was concerned. She may have been writing the book about her late husband, aeronautical daredevil Demon Rumm, but she didn&#x2019;t see the need to play host to the arrogant bad-boy actor starring in the film version&#x2019;s title role. Still, for the good of the project, Kirsten agreed to share her beachfront home with the impossibly sexy screen idol. <br><br>Any other woman would do anything to be in her sandals, but Kirsten wasn&#x2019;t falling for Rylan North, even if he did play his role of male lead to perfection. His down-home charm, his gentleness and virile charisma, might be seducing her in every sense of the word, but he was an actor, after all. Seducing an audience was his job. Rylan could have any woman he wanted. So why was he so desperately pretending to want her?<br><br>From the moment he saw her, Rylan North knew that Kirsten Rumm was the woman he&#x2019;d been waiting all his life to cast as the star in his real-life love story. What did it matter if he was every woman&#x2019;s fantasy if he couldn&#x2019;t get Kirsten to so much as glance his way? He&#x2019;d caught the look of past hurt behind her sky-blue eyes&#x2013;a dark secret that shadowed the sparkle. Rylan was determined to find out what tragedy held this passionate woman back from a second chance at love even if it cost him his reputation, his career, and his life. But first he&#x2019;d have to get Kirsten to act on her instincts . . . and to trust the flesh-and-blood man behind the fantasy.</p><p>When Rylan North flashes Kirsten Rumm his heart-stopping smile, she knows she can&#39;t refuse him...even if letting the actor share her home for a week will force her to relive the last terrible days before her stunt pilot husband fell prey to his own daring acts. Rylan is the perfect choice to play &#34;Demon&#34; Rumm in the movie about his life: no one is more brash, bold, or demanding. But before Rylan immerses himself in Kirsten&#39;s world, he must exorcise the explosive secrets that haunt her dreams...and gamble she&#39;ll find the courage in his arms to risk loving again...Sandra Brown is one of the country's most popular novelists, with fifty-one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers and over seventy million copies of her books in print.

Nausea<br> &nbsp;<br> In the vast valley north of Los Angeles, on a street of abandoned warehouses, behind a wall of corrugated metal topped with barbed wire, beyond an unused machine shop, in an unmarked prefab office building, inside a tiny bathroom with a hollow-core door, our first hero begins to tremble as she steps into a strange pair of pants.<br> &nbsp;<br> These pants are enormous&#x2014;inches thick, visibly stiff, made of a fabric coarse and gray&#x2014;and when she grips the sink for balance, letting them fall, they relax only slightly, a pair of heavy phantom legs leaning against her own. A matching jacket lies felled on the floor like some hunted thing, arms pinned beneath its own weight. On the seat of the closed toilet, an open equipment bag bears a padded red helmet, its dark metal face cage regarding the water-stained ceiling. And on the floor beside it, a clipboard:<br><br> McClelland Security Services<br> Contingency Stress Inoculation Training<br> Dana Bowman, Years 1&#x2013;6<br><br> with colored graph lines for Heart Rate and Test Duration descending.<br> &nbsp;<br> This woman keeps her head bowed, focusing resolutely on the shining silver drain stop at the bottom of the sink. She is able to still herself this way, but over the course of a long minute, the short hair at the back of her neck begins to darken, the skin to shine, and at last a bead forms and slides down to disappear into the rolled cotton edge of her tank. She cranks the sink water on. She flips a wall switch, setting an old ceiling fan rattling. Finally she straightens and pulls the pants up tall, fitting her arms through the ragged straps of the suspenders in front of the mirror. Tall and lean. Short, dark hair. Eyes a clear green. Thin white line of a scar above her upper lip.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is Dana.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stops the stream of water with a still-shaking hand and cups some, sips at it, the bulk of it dribbling from her chin into the sink. She reaches behind her into the equipment bag to grab a long black strip of nylon webbing with a plastic clip. She passes it under the running tap and hikes her tank up to fit it on around her rib cage under her bra, weaving it through the suspender straps and snapping it in front over her sternum. Beyond the red helmet, in the deep of the bag, is a little black wristband with a digital display. She takes a deep breath through her nose&#x2014;nothing you can hear, but you can see her chest rise and keep silently rising, followed by a long, slow fall. Then she fishes out the wristband: forty-four beats per minute.<br> &nbsp;<br> She shuts the water off now and takes two neoprene sleeves from the bag and pulls them on over her forearms. She hefts the coat from the floor like you would a heavy backpack, slinging it on, tiny inside it, and makes short work of the clips in front. Then she picks up the clipboard, tucks the helmet under one arm, and opens the bathroom door.<br> &nbsp;<br> On to a large break room. At the counter is a big young man in a T-shirt and camouflage cargo pants, his brown head shaved shiny bald. He is leaning against a humming microwave, tapping a spoon in his open palm. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The corsage I got isn&#x2019;t going to match.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana lumbers past him, setting her things on the table, and twists the dial on a padlock. Inside her locker is an oversized backpack&#x2014;black ballistic nylon girded with a dozen zippered pockets. He watches as she yanks one open and withdraws a box of Pepto-Bismol tablets and fiddles with a crinkling cellophane sheet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cujo-itis?&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp;<br> She pops a pair of pink tablets into her mouth and shuts her locker door. She twists the dial on the padlock again, and grabs the helmet and clipboard. The color is back in her face now, not so quickly from the pills, of course, but from some internal effort of her own. She manages to smile at him, even. &#x201c;Smell of your mom&#x2019;s leftovers,&#x201d; she says, and she pushes the bar release on a fire door and steps, squinting, out into the bright courtyard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or not a courtyard, really. A half acre of sparkling mica-flecked blacktop hemmed in by those barb-topped walls and bulwarked by the unused warehouses beyond. To one side a line of six black SUVs with dark windows, windshields flashing white in the sun. At the far end a few long runs of chain-link fence leading to a low concrete outbuilding. And at the center a man in a tie and shirtsleeves next to a plain white service van. When the door crashes shut, the little building in the far corner of the yard explodes with muffled barking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana lifts the helmet and swings open the face guard as she crosses the blacktop. She parts the flaps of thick foam at the neck and lowers it over her head, shutting the cage over her pale green eyes and the little white scar. It muffles her hearing, but right away (she will never understand this about herself, but she will continue to crave it) her heart rate slows and her focus sharpens. A paper clip on the blacktop. A helicopter banking south so far off in the turquoise sky she cannot hear it. And just before she reaches him, a flash of something at her examiner&#x2019;s neck as he reaches out for the clipboard. Someone (a barber? his wife?) has nicked him with the clippers just above his collar, a nearly invisible line of fine red marks just below the short hairs, like perforations. Corey Sifter is his name. A former Marine Aircraft Wing Commander and Combat Tactics Instructor from Alabama. Who likes the chair nearest the door in the break room and eats sunflower seeds in his office.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana hands him the clipboard and the wristband to her heart-rate monitor, and in turn he hands her a different -wristband&#x2014;no display, just a white plastic box with a single red button. She slips it on and pushes it up a bit, hiding it inside the sleeve of the big coat.<br> &nbsp;<br> He says, &#x201c;Now, you know that&#x2019;s not just a token of our affection. You can press that thing if you need us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You were in there so long last year, we thought maybe you forgot. Decided you had no choice but to make a roommate out of him and live out your days in the back of that van.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I like living alone, sir,&#x201d; she says.<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughs. &#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; He riffles the pages on the clipboard and then raps it with his knuckle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just hoping you don&#x2019;t fall asleep this time. Your peak heart rate has dropped by at least seven points every year.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana blinks inside her helmet, waiting. She knows such exchanges can go on a long time if she participates in them, and she is itching to get inside the van. She is still hot inside her suit; she is still nauseous. He still has the trace of a smile on his face people wear when they expect that their banter will be returned, but finally it falls away. He coughs and raps his knuckles again on his clipboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Dana opens the barn doors at the rear of the van and climbs in, pulling them shut behind her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The space is dark after the bright outside, but it is also familiar. The pair of bucket seats scabbed with duct tape and the empty rear compartment stripped down to the white sheet-metal skin. An anarchy of scratch marks on the floor as her eyes adjust. The space does for her what the helmet did, and she kneels in the center of the van and feels carefully along the underside of the seats. She leans forward to click the glove box gently open and shut. She does not watch through the windshield as a door in the far building swings open. There is just the soft sifting of her hands along the floor beneath the dashboard, searching, and the rattle of her sneakers as she turns and steps back behind the bucket seats, while outside, silent beyond the van windows, a big German shepherd barrels out, dragging a handler by a leash. It scrabbles toward the van, and Dana crouches on one knee, extending her left arm just as the barn doors swing open, flooding the van with light, and the dog flies at her, teeth bared.</p><h2>Soldiers, Indians &amp; Silver: North America's First Frontier War</h2><p>. 1974, clean copy, Centre for Latin Studies</p><p></p><h2>The Courtneys: 3 Volumes in 1: When the Lion Feeds, The Sound of Thunder, A Sparrow Falls</h2><p>Combines three novels featuring South African Sean Courtney in a saga that chronicles the Zulu threat to Sean&#39;s farm, his hard-won wealth, fierce family conflicts, and his final triumph as soldier and statesman</p><p></p><h2>Love from My Heart to a Snuggly Cuddly Little Boy</h2><p><p>This title is suitable for children of ages 2-5.

It is a tale of heroism and resistance, of friendship and romance, and of unwavering devotion&#x2015;including the readiness to risk one&#x2019;s life&#x2015;to literature and art. And it is entirely true. Based on Jewish, German, and Soviet documents, including diaries, letters, memoirs, and the author&#x2019;s interviews with several of the story&#x2019;s participants, The Book Smugglers chronicles the daring activities of a group of poets turned partisans and scholars turned smugglers in Vilna, &#x201c;The Jerusalem of Lithuania.&#x201d; The rescuers were pitted against Johannes Pohl, a Nazi &#x201c;expert&#x201d; on the Jews, who had been dispatched to Vilna by the Nazi looting agency, Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, to organize the seizure of the city&#x2019;s great collections of Jewish books. Pohl and his Einsatzstab staff planned to ship the most valuable materials to Germany and incinerate the rest. The Germans used forty ghetto inmates as slave-laborers to sort, select, pack, and transport the materials, either to Germany or to nearby paper mills. This group, nicknamed &#x201c;the Paper Brigade,&#x201d; and informally led by poet Shmerke Kaczerginski, a garrulous, street-smart adventurer and master of deception, smuggled thousands of books and manuscripts past German guards. If caught, the men would have faced death by firing squad at Ponar, the mass-murder site outside of Vilna. To store the rescued manuscripts, poet Abraham Sutzkever helped build an underground book-bunker sixty feet beneath the Vilna ghetto.

The capital has fallen. The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne. Now the nation&#39;s fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army. Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives. Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova&#39;s amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling&#39;s secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction--and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she&#39;s fighting for.

In this powerful book, Fredric Jameson proposes a radically different reading of Adorno&#x2019;s work, especially of his major works on philosophy and aesthetics: <i>Negative Dialectics</i> and <i>Aesthetic Theory.</i><br><br>Jameson argues persuasively that Adorno&#x2019;s contribution to the development of Marxism remains unique and indispensable. He shows how Adorno&#x2019;s work on aesthetics performs deconstructive operations yet is in sharp distinction to the now canonical deconstructive genre of writing. He explores the complexity of Adorno&#x2019;s very timely affirmation of philosophy &#x2014; of its possibility after the &#x201c;end&#x201d; of grand theory. Above all, he illuminates the subtlety and richness of Adorno&#x2019;s continuing emphasis on late capitalism as a totality within the very forms of our culture. In its lucidity, <i>Late Marxism</i> echoes the writing of its subject, to whose critical, utopian intelligence Jameson remains faithful.</p><p>Theodor Adorno is widely recognized as one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century, as a foremost cultural critic and philosopher, and one of the most important figures in the Frankfurt School and Western Marxism more generally. And yet, Adorno&#39;s reputation has suffered from accusations about his alleged pessimism and, even worse, from attempts by postmodernists to recruit him to their war against all &#39;grand narratives&#39;, including, most importantly, Marxism itself. In this work Fredric Jameson rescues Adorno from the claws of his critics and the clutches of his false friends. Jameson sees Adorno as not only a thinker whose contribution to Marxism was unique and indispensable, but also as the theorist of late capitalism. Late Marxism introduces Adorno&#39;s thought to a new generation of dissidents and demonstrates the freshness and relevance of dialectical thinking to criticism and resistance today.<b>Fredric Jameson</b> is Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at Duke University.

A young man jumped out, his mouse brown hair and pasty face blending in with the beige of his raincoat. It was midsummer and the sky was cloudless, making the raincoat a strange choice of garment. Equally strange, it was coupled with a pair of large green gumboots that appeared too big for him. He paused, looking and listening in both directions up and down the pass, before grabbing something from the seat of the Land Rover and sprinting to a nearby stile. He looked around once more before starting to wrap the stile, spiderweb fashion, with bright yellow plastic tape. The tape read KEEP OUT. When the stile was effectively blocked, the young man ran back to the Land Rover and took off, tires spraying gravel. As he drove up the pass, he picked up a mobile phone and pressed the redial button."Sector Three now secured, sir," he said."Well done," came the crackling voice down the line. "Now get the hell out of there before they notice."&nbsp;<br>At that very moment an elderly Rover was driving up the Llanberis Pass at a sedate twenty-nine miles per hour, clearly infuriating the driver of a white van behind it. The van bore the inscription LEEKS--THE PROUD SYMBOL OF WALES, STOPPING LEAKS--theproud aim of Roberts-the-Plumber, Bangor. It tried unsuccessfully to pass on numerous occasions but was reduced to impotent horn honkings, which the driver of the Rover didn't seem to hear.At last, beyond the small village of Nant Peris, the Rover finally turned off the road to a parking area outside an old churchyard. Three sheep that had been cropping grass around the lichen-covered gravestones leaped up in alarm at the sound of the car and trotted away to safety behind the old church. The Rover's doors opened and three elderly gentlemen got out, each straightening creaky joints slowly and cautiously. Although they weren't wearing clerical collars but weatherproof windcheaters and stout walking boots, they had an aura of innocent surprise and unworldliness in their faces, usually seen in choirboys or monks. These three were, in fact, Church of England vicars and knew nothing of the austere lifestyle of the monastery. They stood, breathing deeply and looking around with expectation."I bet these old stones could tell many a tale," one of them said, walking over to the moss-grown wall that surrounded the churchyard."If they could, you wouldn't understand it, because it would be in Welsh." The second, the most cherubic-looking of the three, chuckled."Anyway, we're not going to take time to explore now." The third, leaner and fitter looking than his companions, hoisted a rucksack onto his back. "We want to make the summit before the weather changes." He raised his eyes to the mountains that rose steeply on either side. The sky was a perfect blue, without a cloud in sight.Then turning his back on the churchyard, he crossed the road where the sign indicated a footpath up the green slopes beyond. His companions followed him until they came to a stile, straddling a drystone wall. Behind the wall was a rising pasture, dotted with sheep, but the stile was impassible. It was tied across with yellow plastic tape.The first clergyman stopped and waited for his companions to catch up."They can't do this!" he exclaimed, his face pink with anger as he pointed at the taped stile. "It's a public right of way, that's what it is. It's always been a public right of way, and if any bolshie farmer thinks he can stop us from crossing his field just by putting up a piece of tape, then he can think again.""Easy now, Ronald," the cherubic vicar said, putting a hand on his friend's shoulder. "Maybe this path is under repair, or is waterlogged. I'm sure there are plenty of alternate routes up to the summit.""He's right, old man," the third clergyman said in languid, aristocratic tones. "No sense in raising your blood pressure over nothing. Remember what the doctor said."Ronald sighed and turned away. "You're right. Let's take a look at the map and see where the other paths start."But ten minutes later they were at a similar stile farther up the pass, facing a similar strip of yellow tape and the words KEEP OUT scrawled on a piece of cardboard. This time Ronald nearly exploded."That's it. Back to the car. We're going to find the nearest police station and make this farmer open up his damned public right of way!"&nbsp;<br>"Sorry about this, lads, but my hands are tied." Superintendent Meredith spread his hands in a gesture of apology, seeming to refute what he had just said. He was a big man with multiple chins that quivered as he shook his head. "We've had a directive from the powers-that-be that we're to give the Min of Ag all possible cooperation in carrying out this unpleasant task.""It's not going to be easy," a voice from the audience muttered."Look, I know it's not going to be easy, especially for those of us who work closely with the community, but it has to be done." The superintendent attempted an understanding smile. "I feel just as badly as you do about this. But it has to be stopped now. It should have been stopped before it got to Wales. It could have been if they hadn't sat there twiddling their thumbs until it was too late.""Bloody English, when have they ever sent us anything but badnews?" came another growled mutter from the back of the room.If the superintendent heard this, he pretended not to. "So we've just got to buckle down, all pull together, and make sure that there is no unpleasantness, right?" He was the only one who nodded. "The Min of Ag inspectors are already in the area. You'll be approached for assistance as needed." He looked around the audience of blank faces, then went on, "So that's about it. Let's make this go as smoothly as possible, shall we then? And if it looks as if there's going to be trouble, don't hesitate to call for backup. Got it? Right then." He stood up, brushed off his hands as if they had crumbs on them, and strode from the room."All in this together, my arse," one of the young policemen muttered over the scraping of chairs as they got to their feet.Constable Meirion Morgan fell into step beside a fellow officer. "All right for him, isn't it, Evan--sitting here in his office. I bet he's never been within twenty miles of a herd of sheep in his life."The fellow officer he had spoken to, Constable Evan Evans, smiled in agreement. He was a big chap with the build of a rugby player and a boyish face women found appealing. "You know what I'm counting on, Meirion?" he muttered confidentially. "I'm just hoping they'll take their time before they get to us up on the mountain."Meirion Morgan returned the grin. "Oh, that's right. You're transferring to plainclothes, aren't you?""I'm due to start my course next week.""Lucky bugger," Meirion said. "Still, I'm not saying that you don't deserve it.""I've been waiting long enough for the transfer to come through," Evan said. "I applied over a year ago. I was beginning to think they'd never accept me.""They'd have been daft if they hadn't, seeing the kind of help you've already given them.""People don't always take kindly to outside help, do they?" Evans commented.They joined the crowd filing from the briefing room. "You really want to do that kind of thing, do you?" Meirion asked. "Can'tsay it appeals to me. Too much stress and terrible hours. I dare say I lack ambition, but I like being home at a reasonable time and not being called out at three in the morning.""I think I'll like it just fine," Evan said. "I did start a CID training course once, when I was on the force down in Swansea.""Did you now? I never knew that. What in heaven's name were you doing in Swansea? You don't look like a South Walesian, don't sound like one either."Evan laughed. "I was born up here, but my dad got a job with the South Wales Police, so we moved down there when I was ten.""And you were on the force down there then? What made you decide to move back?""Several things." Evan left it at that. "My mum still lives down there.""Can't say I'd want to," Meirion said as they drew level with the cafeteria door. "I've only been to a city once and I felt hemmed in, if you know what I mean. Coming for a cuppa?""No thanks, I'd better be getting back," Evan said. "I'm a one-man shop up in Llanfair, and something always seems to happen when I'm away.""You've got several farms around you, haven't you?" Meirion grimaced. "So have we. I'm not looking forward to it one bit, but I suppose the super is right. It has to be done."He gave Evan a friendly nod as he pushed open the swing door into the cafeteria. Evan got a pleasant whiff of sausage and chips before the door swung to again. He paused and looked back longingly. He'd been surviving on his own for a couple of months now, and he wasn't the world's best cook. After a lifetime of living at home and then being looked after by Mrs. Williams, he was discovering that cooking wasn't as simple as it seemed. Things that looked easy enough usually required ingredients he didn't possess and never turned out like the pictures in the cookery books. Of course he could always buy a meat pie or bangers and chips at the Red Dragon across the road, but that was defeating the whole purpose of this exercise. The whole reason he was putting himself through this was for Bronwen. She had made it very clear that shewouldn't marry him until he'd had a taste of fending for himself.Evan came out of the Caernarfon Police Station and went to retrieve his motorbike. Another good thing about transferring to the CID, he decided, would be giving up that bloody motorbike. It had been issued to outstation officers as part of an efficiency drive, so that they could cover outlying farms more easily, but Evan had never really taken to it. Not that he minded the wind and rain in his face. He'd been brought up in the mountains, after all. He just didn't feel any affinity for motorbikes.He kicked it to life and pulled out of the station yard. It wouldn't have been so bad if he'd been issued an impressive 1000cc model, but this bike was so underpowered that it barely made it up the hill to Llanfair. Any burglar could easily outrun him up a mountainside.The last of the housing estates was left behind, and green uplands soared on either side. A stream danced merrily beside him. Flowers grew in profusion, spilling over the drystone walls. The high pastures were dotted with sheep. It was the perfect pastoral scene, one that he usually relished, but today he looked around with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. This was the calm before the storm. Maybe nothing would ever be the same again.The town of Llanberis was chockablock with families on holiday. The ice cream vendor and the souvenir shops were doing a roaring trade. There was a long line waiting for the next train on the little rack railway up Mt. Snowdon, and a cheerful <i>toot-toot</i> announced that it had just started its climb to the summit. Evan slowed as holidaymakers strolled across the road, trailing children and dripping ice cream. He wondered what would be happening to them. Would they all be sent home? Would the whole area be quarantined?He negotiated the holiday crowds successfully, then let the throttle out as the road narrowed and the pass rose ahead, snaking up to the high country. He felt the exhilaration of wind in his face. Green walls rose on either side, topped with sheets of scree and the rocky crags he knew so well--Snowdon and its outcroppings on his right, and, beyond the thin finger of lake, the twin peaks of the Glydrs on his left. Evan knew every route up the mountains, everychallenging climb in the area, but there hadn't been much time for climbing recently.Nant Peris, with its old church and graveyard, passed on his right. Then there were no more houses until Llanfair. As he pulled up outside his little police substation, he saw a car parked outside it and a white-haired man standing at the station door. On hearing Evan he marched toward him."Are you the officer who is supposed to be on duty here?" he demanded in a well-bred English voice."That's right, sir. Constable Evans. How can I help you?""Aren't police stations supposed to be manned at all times?""Sorry, sir. I'm the only officer stationed up here, and I was called down to headquarters," Evan said. "There's an telephone outside, and they will always send up a squad car in an emergency. So what can I do for you?""What you can do is go and talk to some damned farmer," the man said. "We're here on a walking holiday, and we were just about to hike up Glydr Fach when we found the path had been blocked off." Evan glanced over at the car where two other elderly men with round cherubic faces watched from wound-down windows. "My fellow members of the clergy and I have been coming here every summer since 1956, and until now we have had no problems."Evan was just realizing the implications of the man's complaint. "The path was blocked, you say?" he asked."Taped across, more like it," one of the other elderly gentlemen chimed in from the car. "Lots of yellow plastic tape. And not just one path either. We drove up to the second footpath, and it had tape across it too. And the words 'Keep Out.'""Some bolshie farmer trying to deny an ancient right of way," the first man said. "It happens from time to time. Some chap thinks he can ignore a public footpath across his land. But we never let them get away with it. We'd like you to go and talk to him, Constable. Let him know that it's against the law to block off a right of way.""I'll come down and see it with you," Evan said, "but I don't think the farmer had anything to do with it this time. I don't knowwhether you've been reading the papers, but I'm afraid that foot-and-mouth disease has spread to this part of Wales. I was just at a briefing in Caernarfon, and it doesn't look good. It seems it's only a matter of time before the farmers here have to slaughter their flocks."The man's bluster evaporated. "But that's terrible," he said with concern. "So you think that was why they've blocked off the footpaths?""I would imagine so, sir. I understand the Ministry of Agriculture's men are already in the area doing inspections, and they'll be doing everything they can to stop the disease from spreading--which would mean closing footpaths, I expect.""Of course, I quite understand," the vicar said, nodding to his fellows. "They wouldn't want to risk having anyone carrying infected soil on his boots. Well, this is a setback, I must say.""It will completely spoil our holiday," one of the men in the car said."I should think it will spoil a lot of holidays," Evan said. "The timing couldn't have been worse, right at the beginning of the school summer holidays too. It will be a disaster for all the local business people.""Yes, I suppose it will. Never thought of that." The vicar stood staring up at the mountains with a wistful look on his face. "So what do you suggest, Constable? Do you think we should get out as soon as possible and try somewhere else?"Evan glanced up at the hills, from which came the sporadic bleating of sheep. "You're all clergymen, you say? Then I suggest you gentlemen do some serious prayin...</p><h2>Seeing Voices: A Journey Into the World of the Deaf</h2><p>A physician, professor of neurology and author, Oliver Sacks (1933-2015) has been described by the New York Times as 'a kind of poet laureate of contemporary medicine'. His books are made up of case histories of his patients, and explore both their neurological disorders and the strategies they adopted to cope with them.<br>In Seeing Voices, a journey into the world of the profoundly deaf, Sacks examines the consequences of living in silence, including the different ways in which the deaf and the hearing learn to categorize and convey the experience of their respective worlds.</p><p>"This book will shake your preconceptions about the deaf, about language and about thought--. Sacks [is] one of the finest and most thoughtful writers of our time."--"Los Angeles Times Book Review <br>Like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, this is a fascinating voyage into a strange and wonderful land, a provocative meditation on communication, biology, adaptation, and culture. In Seeing Voices, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect--a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. Seeing Voices is, as Studs Terkel has written, "an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work."Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books, including The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Awakenings (which inspired the Oscar-nominated film) and Musicophilia. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York City, where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University. He is the first, and only, Columbia University Artist, and is also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 2008, he was appointed Commander of the British Empire.

Angela is six years old and worries for the Baby Jesus on the altar of St. Joseph's Church near School House Lane in Limerick, Ireland, where she lives. December nights are damp and cold, and the church is dark. The Baby Jesus' mother doesn't even have a blanket to cover him. The Baby is sure to need Angela's help, even if she is not allowed to step near the altar, especially by herself. </p><p> Filled with the character and incident that have made Pulitzer Prize recipient Frank McCourt internationally renowned and beloved, Angela and the Baby Jesus is a timeless story of family--and all of its joy, tradition, love, and incongruity--and a book for the generations to cherish. </p><p> <br> </p> <br><b>Amazon.com Exclusive</b><br><i>Angela and the Baby Jesus</i>, the first Christmas book from beloved author Frank McCourt, is an unprecedented event, with a children's edition published by Simon &amp; Schuster Children's Publishing and an adult edition published by Scribner. Set in Ireland, the story is about the childhood of Angela, of <i>Angela's Ashes</i>. Each edition has the same story written by McCourt but is illustrated by a different artist. Raul Colon illustrated the children's edition and Loren Long illustrated the adult edition. Amazon asked both artists to write about their experiences illustrating the same scene from McCourt's story to get an inside look at how they interpreted McCourt's words. <br><br><b>Raul Colon on the Fireside Scene from <i>Angela and the Baby Jesus</i></b>:<br>This image for Frank McCourt's <i>Angela and the Baby Jesus</i> picture book came to me just by thinking of a warm fireplace on a cold night. <p>In this particular scene the family sits around the fire to chat after tea. Angela's little brother is giving up the secret that the "Baby Jesus" is in the bed upstairs. Angela shows a bit of worry in her face, since she quietly snuck the "baby" into the house. Surely she'll be in trouble now. </p><p>Throughout the story I hardly show any of the adult faces, focusing mainly on the children's world. Hence, Mother's back is turned toward us. I also cut off the little brother's face by having Mother's turn-of-the-century hairdo get in the way (A little thing I learned from the great artist Degas.) It gives the scene intimacy, as if the viewer is there taking a snapshot with his camera. All in all a fun and rewarding book to illustrate. It was an honor to turn McCourt's words into actual pictures. <i>--Raul Colon</i><br> <b>Loren Long on the Fireside Scene from <i>Angela and the Baby Jesus</i></b>:<br>Usually little Angela would want to be right in the middle of the action as the family sits by the fire and talks. But not this time--she has a secret upstairs. </p><p>At this point in the story, I'm giving the reader a seat behind the family in the shadows away from the fire. At the same time we, the readers, know about Angela's secret in the bedroom upstairs and we see her hanging back from the others, sneaking peeks up the staircase. We can see that she has something more important on her mind than her family's chattering. </p><p>In my visual interpretation of <i>Angela and the Baby Jesus</i>, I wanted to tap into Frank McCourt's sophisticated blend of gritty realism and subtle humor. For this reason, I specifically chose a limited color palette. I worked with acrylics on canvas and tried to keep the paintings a bit edgy and raw. </p><p>Choosing images came naturally when working on this story. I was taken with the balance of reverence, innocence, and humor in Frank&#x2019;s text and I simply tried to come up with creative ways to portray these elements in a subtle but hopefully profound way. <i>--Loren Long</i><br> </p><b>Frank McCourt</b> (1930-2009) was born in in Brooklyn, New York, to Irish immigrant parents, grew up in Limerick, Ireland, and returned to America in 1949.

An exploration of Austen's passion for the stage&#x2014;she acted in amateur productions, frequently attended the theatre, and even scripted several early works in play form&#x2014;it took a nuanced look at how powerfully her stories were influenced by theatrical comedy.<br><br>This updated edition features an introduction and a brand new chapter that delves into the long and lucrative history of Austen adaptations. The film world's love affair with Austen spans decades, from A.A. Milne's "Elizabeth Bennet," performed over the radio in 1944 to raise morale, to this year's <em>Love and Friendship</em>. Austen's work has proven so abidingly popular that these movies are more easily identifiable by lead actor than by title: the Emma Thompson <em>Sense and Sensibility, </em>the Carey Mulligan <em>Northanger Abbey,</em> the Laurence Olivier <em>Pride and Prejudice. </em>Byrne even takes a captivating detour into a multitude of successful spin-offs, including the phenomenally brilliant <em>Clueless.</em> And along the way, she overturns the notion of Jane Austen as a genteel, prim country mouse, demonstrating that Jane's enduring popularity in film, TV, and theater points to a woman of wild comedy and outrageous behavior.</p><p>For lovers of everything Jane Austen, as well as for a new generation discovering her for the first time, <em>The&nbsp;Genius of Jane Austen&nbsp;</em>demonstrates why this beloved author still resonates with readers and movie audiences today.<br><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><strong></strong><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Paula Byrne is the critically acclaimed author of five biographies, including <em>Belle: The Slave Daughter and the Lord Chief Justice</em>, <em>The Real Jane Austen</em>, and <em>Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead.</em> She lives in Oxford, England, with her husband, the academic and biographer Jonathan Bate.</p>&#x201c;Byrne presents an Austen immersed in her time&#x2019;s popular entertainment...any Austen devotee should appreciate the thorough analysis of the novels and the crediting of previously overlooked influences.&#x201d; (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Paula Byrne&#x2019;s THE GENIUS OF JANE AUSTEN gives us the most insightful analysis of the making of the Austen legacy. Byrne&#x2019;s investigation into Austen&#x2019;s enjoyment of plays...gives us real insight into how Austen learned to focus her material, make it amusing and give it critical punch...Byrne demonstrates her own ample knowledge of the history of the English theater. The illustrations she has included are colorful and instructive...Thanks to Paula Byrne, I now readily see that the amusement Austen is giving me (and herself) was inspired by plays Austen knew well and techniques she saw on the stage.&#x201d; (Jane Smiley, <em>New York Times</em> Book Review)</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>It&#x2019;s the job of a science fiction writer to visualize extrapolations of the future. But there are those who go far beyond, venturing into realms of breathtaking science. That kind of cutting edge talent is as rare as a supernova&#x2014;and, in its own way, just as powerful. Arthur C. Clarke had it. So did William Gibson. Now, with <i>Evolution</i>, Stephen Baxter delivers what is sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year&#x2014;and shows once again why he belongs among the select company of science fiction writers who matter.<br><br>Stretching from the distant past into the remote future, from primordial Earth to the stars, <i>Evolution</i> is a soaring symphony of struggle, extinction, and survival, a dazzling epic that combines a dozen scientific disciplines and a cast of unforgettable characters to convey the grand drama of evolution in all its awesome majesty and rigorous beauty.<br><br>Sixty-five million years ago, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth, lived a small mammal, a proto-primate of the species <i>Purgatorius</i>. From this humble beginning, Baxter traces the human lineage forward through time. The adventure that unfolds is a gripping odyssey governed by chance and competition, a perilous journey to an uncertain destination along a route beset by sudden and catastrophic upheavals. It is a route that ends, for most species, in stagnation or extinction. Why should humanity escape this fate?<br><br>A generation from today, a group of concerned scientists&#x2014;distant descendants of that primitive <i>Purgatorius</i>&#x2014;gathers on a remote island to discuss this very question. The ceaseless expansion of human civilization has triggered an urgent environmental crisis that must be solved now if the Earth is to survive as a place hospitable to human life. But just when a peaceful solution seems within reach, two acts of shocking violence set in motion a cataclysmic chain of events that will expose the limitations of human intellect and adaptability in the face of the blind and implacable processes of Darwin&#x2019;s dangerous idea.</p><p>Following up his cosmic Manifold series, Stephen Baxter peers back on a more prosaic history in the worthy yet uneven <i>Evolution</i>. The book is nothing less than a novelization of human evolution, a mega-Michener treatment of 65 million years starring a host of smart, furry primates representing <i>Homo sapiens</i>'s ancestry. Each stage of our ancestry is represented by a character of progressively increasing intelligence, empathy, and brain size, who must survive predation and other perils long enough to keep the natural-selection ball rolling. While Baxter carefully follows some widely accepted theories of evolution--punctuated equilibrium, for instance--he also strays from the known in postulating air whales and sentient, tool-wielding dinosaurs. And why not? There's nothing in the fossil record to contradict his musings about those things, or about the first instances of mammalian altruism and deception, which he also lets us observe. From little Purga, a shrewlike mammal scurrying under the feet of ankylosaurs, all the way through Ultimate, the last human descendant, Baxter adds drama and a strong story arc to our past and future. But he spends too much time on details of the various prehumans' lives, which can become repetitive: fight, mate, die, ad infinitum. And readers eager for a science-fictional adventure will only find satisfaction in the posthuman chapters at the end. Despite these flaws, <i>Evolution</i> grips the attention with an epoch-spanning tale of the random changes that rule our genetic heritage.

Raesinia said.<br><br> "Nearly, Your Highness," said the royal dressmaker, a plump, red-faced woman who towered over her diminutive monarch. "One more, if you please. Take a breath and hold it."<br><br> Raesinia complied, and the dressmaker whipped a knotted cord around her middle with expert speed. She muttered to herself and tugged it a bit tighter, then looked.<br><br> "Wonderful. Thank you, Your Highness. I must say you are very lucky to have such a slender frame. And such beautiful skin! You will look magnificent."<br><br> Raesinia caught her own gaze in the mirror over the dressmaker's shoulder and rolled her eyes. Stripped down to her underthings, she could see the truth clearly enough. I look like a child. And she always would.<br><br> Her unaging state could be inconvenient, but her actual appearance had never really bothered her. It could be useful even-with the right outfit, she could pass for a boy, and political opponents had a persistent tendency to underestimate her. She'd never particularly wanted male attention, though it had occasionally come her way regardless. Poor Ben, who tried to protect me and died for it. Now, though . . .<br><br> "One in sea green, I think," the dressmaker was saying. "And one in that lovely Hamveltai crimson. I know just the supplier. And then-"<br><br> "I leave it entirely in your hands," Raesinia said. "But you must excuse me. There's a great deal of business to attend to."<br><br> That was wrong, she realized at once. A queen didn't ask a servant to excuse her. I should tell her to go. But politeness had been ground into Raesinia since her earliest education, and now that she was back in the palace, all the old lessons had resurfaced.<br><br> "Of course." The dressmaker bowed deeply. "I am honored by your custom, Your Highness."<br><br> Joanna opened the door. The large, silent woman and her slim, more talkative partner, Barely, were on permanent detachment from the Girls' Own as Raesinia's personal guards. Their presence had already become a comforting part of her landscape, and it was hard to imagine that she'd once been without them. They'd been part of the group that rescued her from the Penitent Damned and Maurisk's Directory, and they'd stayed at her side through the horrors of the Murnskai campaign. While Joanna was resplendent in a well-tailored blue-and-silver dress uniform, Raesinia had no doubt that the sword and pistol on her belt were extremely functional. Even with Vordan more or less at peace, it was a comforting thought.<br><br> "Tell Barely to send the girls in, please," Raesinia said.<br><br> Joanna nodded and leaned out the door. She never spoke, but she and her partner had a private language of hand signals that let her make herself understood. Raesinia was resolved to learn it herself someday. When I have time.<br><br> Someday I'll have all the time in the world.<br><br> Two young women in palace livery swept in and went to work, silent and efficient. Raesinia stood stock-still, raising or lowering her arms as required, feeling a bit like an articulated dummy. On campaign with the army, she'd mostly gotten away with reasonably practical riding outfits, and before that she'd still been in official mourning for her father. Now, though, with the echoes of the victory celebrations still fading from the palace and life returning to something like normal, standards had to be maintained. Or so said Mistress Lagovil, the intimidating head of the palace staff, and Raesinia hadn't yet worked up the nerve to argue with her.<br><br> One of those standards, apparently, was that the queen couldn't be seen in any outfit that she could possibly don under her own power. Raesinia had pushed for a little practicality-she did have work to do, whatever Mistress Lagovil might say-but that still meant yards of lace and silk, carefully matched with rings, bracelets, combs, necklaces, and whatever else could be scrounged from the Royal Jewelhouse. To Raesinia's eyes the final effect was, at best, "sparkly." She'd been raised to appreciate palace fashion, but the lessons had never really sunk in.<br><br> Mistress Lagovil had apologized for the sorry state of the wardrobe, and indeed the rest of Ohnlei. The palace had been sacked once by the revolution and again when Janus' army had been quartered there. Furniture had been broken up for firewood and drapes torn apart for uniforms and bandages. Much of the staff was gone, fled or drafted into the army, and only a handful had returned despite the end of the war. The nobles who'd once lent their splendor to the court were still mostly hunkered down at their country estates, waiting to be sure the storm had well and truly passed, and Raesinia couldn't say she blamed them.<br><br> At least some of the more tedious rituals had been temporarily suspended. Raesinia could take her meals in her quarters-the Grand Hall had been used to stable cavalry mounts and was still being cleaned out-and there were few dignitaries who required official receptions. No one suggested going hunting. Privately, Raesinia dreaded the day the full splendor of the palace was restored. Before her father's death, her days had been as tightly regulated as a clockmaker's apprentice, jammed with lessons, formal dinners, court outings, and other official occasions.<br><br> Once she was dressed, Raesinia took a few tentative steps in front of the mirror, to confirm that she could walk without anything falling off. It wasn't a bad dress, really, a deep Vordanai blue accented with silver, flattering to a figure that didn't have much to flatter. Raesinia rolled her eyes at herself again, signaled her approval to the maids, and followed them out into her private chambers.<br><br> Eric was waiting for her, practically vibrating with nerves, and Raesinia stifled a sigh. It really wasn't his fault, as he'd been thrust into a job he'd had no preparation for-he'd been a clerk doing the palace accounts until Raesinia had asked Mistress Lagovil for an assistant, and he was still overawed by the royal presence. He was competent enough, but . . .<br><br> No but. It's not his fault that he's not Sothe. Every time she saw Eric's too-serious face, struggling to maintain the constipated expression he associated with proper dignity, Raesinia missed her old maidservant. Maidservant, bodyguard, spy, assassin. Friend. She'd left, after thwarting Orlanko's assassins on the final night of the Murnskai campaign. Where are you, Sothe?<br><br> "Your Highness," Eric said. "You look lovely. And the dressmaker has given me her assurances that everything will be ready before-"<br><br> Raesinia waved a hand. "I'm sure she'll do fine. What do we have today?"<br><br> Eric looked down at the leather notebook he always carried. "The Duke of Brookspring is expecting you in twenty minutes, Your Highness. Then lunch with Mistress Cora, and you agreed to grant an audience to Deputy d'Andorre."<br><br> See? I do have work to do. Even if it sometimes seemed like everyone wanted her to sit back and ignore it. "We'd better get started, then."<br><br> The old Borelgai embassy, a rambling, ancient stone pile at the edge of the palace grounds, had been burned by a mob during the revolution. For now the Borelgai ambassador and his staff had been assigned to a suite in the palace itself. Eric led the way there, through corridors largely deserted except for guards at regular intervals. The soldiers-part of the First Division had the honor today, Raesinia saw-came smartly to attention as she passed. Joanna and Barely, her constant shadows, followed a few steps behind her.<br><br> "Did Dorsay say why he wanted to see me?" Raesinia said.<br><br> "His Grace did not mention a specific reason," Eric said. "As far as I'm aware, the treaty is progressing well, if slowly."<br><br> That was Dorsay's ostensible reason for being in Vordan, the peace treaty that would officially end the war between their two countries. There were a great many details to be ironed out, and in practice the negotiations were conducted between a swarm of bureaucrats from both sides. Trying to understand the actual points of contention made Raesinia's head hurt, but she did her best to keep abreast of the general shape of things. Dorsay didn't even seem to do that, happy to let his underlings do the work. Raesinia suspected he was here more as a reminder than anything else, Borel's greatest living soldier showing the flag to underline the fact that-unlike all her other opponents-Vordan hadn't beaten the Borelgai in open battle.<br><br> Two Borelgai Life Guards, their shakos lined with their trademark white fur, stood guard outside the door to the embassy suite. They came to attention as well, and the door opened to reveal the perpetual smile of Ihannes Pulwer-Monsangton, Borel's ambassador to Vordan. If Dorsay was all bluff informality, which Raesinia had come to respect during their time in Murnsk, Ihannes was the opposite, with the oily charm of the professional diplomat. Raesinia presented him with her own best smile and acknowledged his slight bow with a nod.<br><br> "Your Highness," he said. "You honor us."<br><br> "Ambassador." Raesinia paused when Ihannes didn't move aside.<br><br> His smile turned apologetic. "His Grace has asked that this be a private meeting."<br><br> "Of course." Raesinia gestured for Joanna and Barely to wait. "Eric, find me after my meeting with Mistress Cora."<br><br> Ihannes stepped aside, and Raesinia swept past him. The Borelgai suite was elaborately furnished, by the standards of the depleted palace, with furniture and decorations in the severe Borelgai style. More diplomatic posturing, she assumed.<br><br> Attua Dorsay, the Duke of Brookspring, was seated at the head of the long table, vigorously applying butter and jam to several slices of toast. Ihannes cleared his throat theatrically, and Dorsay looked up.<br><br> "You getting a cough, Ihannes?" he said. The twinkle in his eye made Raesinia certain he was needling the ambassador.<br><br> "No, Your Grace." Ihannes stepped aside. "The queen is here."<br><br> "I can see that," Dorsay said. He gestured at his plate. "Care for any breakfast, Your Highness?"<br><br> "No, thank you," Raesinia said, barely restraining a smile at Ihannes' pained expression.<br><br> "Sit down, then. That'll be all, Ihannes."<br><br> "Your Grace?" The ambassador's brow furrowed.<br><br> "I mean take yourself somewhere else," Dorsay said. "I told you I wanted this to be a private meeting."<br><br> Ihannes' expression went even frostier, but he bowed silently and left through an inner door. Dorsay resumed buttering his toast, which was already dripping.<br><br> "Butter," he said without much preamble. "You people have always been good at it."<br><br> "Thank you, Your Grace," Raesinia said cautiously.<br><br> "Butter, cream, cheese, and so on. All in short supply back home, since the war started. Do you know how much of our cheese comes from Vordan?" Before she could answer, he waved a hand. "I didn't, and neither did Georg. Nobody thinks about these things before they start a war."<br><br> Georg referred to Georg Pulwer, the King of Borel, with whom Dorsay was apparently on a first-name basis. Raesinia wasn't sure how much of that was bluster and how much was truth. It was always hard to tell with Dorsay.<br><br> "It was you who put us under blockade," Raesinia said, keeping her tone light. "If it were up to me, His Majesty could have all the cheese he could eat."<br><br> "Which is a shockingly large amount, I can attest." Dorsay crunched into the toast, getting flecks of butter in his bristly mustache. He sat back and sighed with pleasure. "Hells. No beating the real stuff. Back home they try to make something with goat's milk, if you can believe that. Goat's milk! Ha."<br><br> "Once the treaty is finished, I'll send a few casks with you, as a going-away present."<br><br> "A small price to pay to be rid of me!" Dorsay cackled. "No doubt you'll throw a party to celebrate."<br><br> "You'll always be welcome at my court," Raesinia said. "You helped me keep the peace when we might as easily have been at each other's throats."<br><br> "And your man d'Ivoire saved my neck from that snake Orlanko," Dorsay said. "I won't forget it, believe me." He finished the toast, wiped his face on a napkin, and turned to look up at her. His famous nose, long and curved, stuck out like the prow of a ship. "That's the spirit in which I asked you here, in fact. Nothing to do with the treaty. Wanted to pass on a bit of private information."<br><br> "Oh?" Raesinia hesitated for moment, then pulled a heavy wooden chair from the table and settled herself facing Dorsay. "Information is always appreciated."<br><br> "How much are you hearing out of Murnsk?"<br><br> "Not a great deal," Raesinia admitted. "They withdrew their ambassador when the war started, and we haven't received any official response to our inquiries since. The Army of the North has pulled back over the border into Vordan."<br><br> "I suspected as much. Our forces have pulled out as well, but Borel has significant commercial interest in western Murnsk, and sometimes they pass tidbits along."<br><br> Raesinia nodded. Once again, she missed Sothe. Vordan's intelligence service had been largely dismantled in the wake of Orlanko's rebellion, but Sothe had a knack for acquiring information. Raesinia had tasked Alek Giforte with creating something to fill the void left by the Concordat, but that project was still in its infancy.<br><br> "Western Murnsk is in chaos," Dorsay went on. "To put it mildly. The bizarre weather has wreaked havoc, and to make matters worse, the northern savages have crossed the Bataria in strength, raiding and burning as they go. I imagine you saw some of that for yourself."<br><br> "I did indeed," Raesinia said. Dorsay didn't know that neither event was a coincidence-the summer had turned freezing under the magical influence of the Black Priests, and the Trans-Batariai tribes had come in response to Elysium's call to defeat the approaching Vordanai army. "What is the emperor doing about it?"<br><br> "Not a great deal, and that's the part that's odd. There are some strange rumors coming out of Mohkba. Some people are saying the emperor's dead, and others insist that Prince Cesha Dzurk is a traitor and is lying about it to seize the throne."<br><br> "Janus smashed at least two sizable Murnskai armies on his way north," Raesinia said. "We heard that the crown prince was killed in the fighting. It wouldn't be a surprise if all that caused some upheaval." She shook her head. "If the harvest was ruined, the whole region must be facing famine. Perhaps we should organize some kind of aid."<br><br> "It's not usually the winners of a war who offer help to the losers," Dorsay said, eyes twinkling.<br><br> "We were never at war with the people of Murnsk," Raesinia said. "Our quarrel was with Elysium. And the emperor, once he set himself against us."<br><br> "Elysium is the crux of it," Dorsay said. "Something very strange has happened there. As best we can tell, much of the Church administration has decamped, legging it for Mohkba and points east as fast as their mules will carry them. No one has gotten close enough to Elysium to find out what's happening there in weeks. People who try just . . ." He waved his hands.

In this sharp, insightful account, Douthat evaluates his social and academic education--most notably, his frustrations with pre-established social hierarchies and the trumping of intellectual rigor by political correctness and personal ambition. The book addresses the spectacles of his time there, such as the embezzlement scandal at the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and Professor Cornel West's defection to Princeton. He also chronicles the more commonplace but equally revealing experiences, including social climbing, sexual relations, and job hunting.<br><br> While the book's narrative centers on Harvard, its main arguments have a much broader concern: the state of the American college experience. <em>Privilege</em> is a pointed reflection on students, parents, and even administrators and professors who perceive specific schools merely as stepping-stones to high salaries and elite social networks rather than as institutions entrusted with academic excellence.<br><br> A book full of insightful perceptions and illuminating detail, <em>Privilege</em> is sure to spark endless debates inside and outside the ivied walls.</p><p>While at Harvard, <strong>Ross Gregory Douthat</strong> wrote a biweekly column for the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> and edited the <em>Harvard Salient</em>. He now works at the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> and lives in Washington, D.C.*Starred Review* Its very name a cultural weapon, Harvard arms the fortunate few it admits with such social power that they can "drop the H bomb" on overawed listeners merely by mentioning where they attend school. How this revered institution and its students acquired such daunting social power and whether they still deserve it are the questions at the heart of this incisive critique written from the Right. Douthat offers a withering indictment of Harvard's institutional culture, a culture in which the administration (and not just the president), the faculty, and the students have all drifted into self-congratulatory complacency. In the academic world Douthat describes, professors have long since repudiated traditional moral imperatives and have now distanced themselves from the gauche radicalism of the hard Left, so contenting themselves with the abundance provided by global capitalism and the moral bromides generated by parlor liberalism. Such professors provide little educational guidance to students themselves too smugly impressed with their own achievement in winning admission to the school to worry much about intellectual labors not requisite for careers of affluence and prominence. Douthat recognizes that his own years at Harvard permitted him the luxury of stimulating out-of-class discussions with brilliant fellow students, but those moments of inspiration came in spite of the cozy creed of careerist success that has established itself as the only orthodoxy at the nation's premier university. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It blew dark clouds across the sky and whistled through the leaves, now hinting at fall. Along the roadside the trees appeared more yellow than green, and touches of f lame and scarlet were beginning to show. The day was poised in September, just as summer was turning autumn. The late afternoon sunshine squeezed between the clouds, slanting onto the roadway.<br><br>The air smelled of rain. Lindsay walked swiftly, knowing the clouds could win out at any moment. The breeze lifted and tossed the strands of her silvery blond hair, and she pushed at them with annoyance. She would have been wiser to have left it neatly pinned at the nape of her neck, she thought.<br><br>Had she not been so pressed for time, Lindsay would have enjoyed the walk. She would have reveled at the hint of fall and the threatening storm. Now, however, she hurried along the roadway wondering what else could go wrong.<br><br>In the three years since she had returned to Connecticut to teach, she had experienced some rough moments. But this, she decided, was among the top ten for frustration value. Backed up plumbing in the studio, a forty-five minute lecture from an overeager parent on her child's prowess, two torn costumes and a student with an upset stomach&#x2014;these minor annoyances had culminated with her temperamental car. It had coughed and moaned as usual when she had turned the ignition, but then it had failed to pull itself together. It simply had sat there shuddering until Lindsay had admitted defeat. This car, she thought with a rueful smile, is about as old as I am, and we're both tired.<br><br>After taking a hopeless look under the hood, Lindsay had gritted her teeth and begun the two-and-a-half-mile hike home from the studio.<br><br>Of course, she admitted as she trudged along under the shifting sunlight, she could have called someone. She sighed, knowing her temper had set her off. Ten minutes of brisk walking had cooled it. Nerves, she told herself. I'm just nervous about the recital tonight. Not the recital, technically, she corrected, stuffing her hands into her pockets. The girls are ready; rehearsals had been perfect. The little ones are cute enough that mistakes won't matter. It was the times before and after the recitals that distressed Lindsay. And the parents.<br><br>She knew that some would be dissatisfied with their children's parts. And more still who would try to pressure her into accelerating the training. Why wasn't their Pavlova on <i>pointe </i>yet? Why did Mrs. Jones's ballerina have a bigger part than Mrs. Smith's? Shouldn't Sue move on to the intermediate class?<br><br>So often Lindsay's explanations on anatomy, growing bones, endurance and timing met with only more suggestions. Normally, she used a mixture of f lattery, stubbornness and intimidation to hold them off. She prided herself on being able to handle overzealous parents. After all, she mused, hadn't her mother been exactly the same?<br><br>Above all else, Mae Dunne had wanted to see her daughter on stage. She herself was short-legged, with a small, compact body. But she had possessed the soul of a dancer. Through sheer determination and training, she had secured a place in the <i>corps de ballet </i>with a small touring company.<br><br>Mae had been nearly thirty when she married. Resigned that she would never be a principal dancer, she had turned to teaching for a short time, but her own frustrations made her a poor instructor. Lindsay's birth had altered everything. She could never be a prima ballerina, but her daughter would.<br><br>Lessons for Lindsay had begun at age five with Mae in constant attendance. From that time on, her life had been a f lurry of lessons, recitals, ballet shoes and classical music. Her diet had been scrupulously monitored, her height agonized over until it was certain that five-feet-two was all she would achieve. Mae had been pleased. Toe shoes add six inches to a dancer's height, and a tall ballerina has a more difficult time finding partners.<br><br>Lindsay had inherited her mother's height, but to Mae's pride, her body was slender and delicate. After a brief, awkward stage, Lindsay had emerged as a teenager with fawnlike beauty: fragile blond hair, ivory skin, and Viking blue eyes with brows thin and naturally arched. Her bone structure was elegant, masking a sturdy strength gained from years of training. Her arms and legs were slim with the long muscles of a classical dancer. All of Mae's prayers had been answered.<br><br>Lindsay looked the part of a ballerina, and she had the talent. Mae didn't need a teacher to confirm what she could see for herself. There were the coordination, the technique, the endurance and the ability. But more, there was the heart.<br><br>At eighteen Lindsay had been accepted into a New York company.<br><br>Unlike her mother, she did not remain in the <i>corps. </i>She advanced to soloist, then, the year she turned twenty, she became a principal dancer. For nearly two years it seemed that Mae's dreams were reality. Then, without warning, Lindsay had been forced to give up her position and return to Connecticut.<br><br>For three years teaching dance had been her profession. Though Mae was bitter, Lindsay was more philosophical. She was a dancer still. That would never change.<br><br>The clouds shifted again to block out the sun. Lindsay shivered and wished she had remembered her jacket. It sat in the front seat of her car, where, in the heat of her temper, she had tossed it. Her arms were now bare, covered only at the shoulders by a pale blue leotard. She had pulled on jeans, and her leg-warmers helped, but she thought longingly of the jacket. Because thinking of it failed to warm her, Lindsay quickened her pace to a jog. Her muscles responded instantly. There was a f luidity to the motion, a grace instinctive rather than planned. She began to enjoy the run. It was her nature to hunt for pleasure and to find it.<br><br>Abruptly, as if a hand had pulled the plug, the rain began. Lindsay stopped to stare up at the churning, black sky. "What else?" she demanded. A deep roar of thunder answered her. With a half-laugh, she shook her head. The Moorefield house was just across the street. She decided to do what she should have done initially: ask Andy to drive her home. Hugging her arms, she stepped out into the road.<br><br>The rude blast of a horn had her heart bounding to her throat. Her head snapped around, and she made out the dim shape of a car approaching through the curtain of rain. Instantly she leaped out of the way, slipping on the wet pavement and landing with a splash in a shallow puddle.<br><br>Lindsay shut her eyes as her pulse quickened. She heard the high squeal of brakes and the skid of tires. Years from now, she thought as the cold wetness soaked through her jeans, I'll laugh at this. But not now. She kicked and sent a small spray of water flying. <br><br><i>"Are you out of your mind?" </i><br><br>Lindsay heard the roar through the rain and opened her eyes. Standing over her was a raging, wet giant. Or a devil, she thought, eyeing him warily as he towered over her. He was dressed in black. His hair was black as well; sleek and wet, it enhanced a tanned, rawboned face. There was something faintly wicked about that face. Perhaps it was the dark brows that rose ever so slightly at the ends. Perhaps it was the strange contrast of his eyes, a pale green that brought the sea to mind. And at the moment, they were furious. His nose was long and rather sharp, adding to the angular impression of his face. His clothes were plastered against his body by the rain and revealed a firm, well-proportioned frame. Had she not been so absorbed with his face, Lindsay would have admired it professionally. Speechless, she only stared up at him, her eyes huge.<br><br>"Are you hurt?" he demanded when she failed to answer his first question. There was no concern in his voice, only restrained anger. Lindsay shook her head and continued to stare. With an impatient oath, he took her arms and pulled her up, lifting her well off the ground before he set her on her feet."Don't you look where you're going?" he tossed out, giving her a quick shake before releasing her.<br><br>He was not the giant Lindsay had first imagined. He was tall, cer-tainly&#x2014;perhaps a foot taller than herself&#x2014;but hardly a bone-crushing giant or satanic apparition. She began to feel more foolish than frightened.<br><br>"I'm terribly sorry," she began. She was fully aware that she had been at fault and equally willing to admit it. "I did look, but I didn't..."<br><br>"Looked?" he interrupted. The impatience in his tone barely covered a deeper, tightly controlled fury. "Then perhaps you'd better start wearing your glasses. I'm sure your father paid good money for them."<br><br>Lightning f lashed once, slicing white across the sky. More than the words, Lindsay resented the tone. "I don't wear glasses,"she retorted.<br><br>"Then perhaps you should."<br><br>"My eyes are fine." She pushed clinging hair from her brow.<br><br>"Then you certainly should know better than to walk out into the middle of the street."<br><br>Rain streamed down her face as she glared at him. She wondered that it didn't turn to steam. "I apologized," she snapped, placing her hands on her hips. "Or had begun to before you jumped on me. If you expect groveling, you can forget it. If you hadn't been so heavy on the horn, I wouldn't have slipped and landed in that stupid puddle." She wiped ineffectually at the seat of her pants. "I don't suppose it occurs to you to apologize?"<br><br>"No," he answered evenly, "it doesn't. I'm hardly responsible for your clumsiness."<br><br>"Clumsiness?" Lindsay repeated. Her eyes grew round and wide. <i>"Clumsiness?" </i>On the repetition, her voice broke. To her, there was no insult more vile. <i>"How dare you!" </i><br><br>She would take the dunk in the puddle, she would take his rudeness, but she would not take that. "You're the most deplorable excuse for a man I've ever met!" Her face was aglow with passion now, and she pushed impatiently at the hair the rain continued to nudge into her eyes. They shone an impossibly vivid blue against her f lushed skin. "You nearly run me down, frighten me to death, push me into a puddle, lecture me as if I were a near-sighted child and now, <i>now </i>you have the nerve to call me <i>clumsy!</i><br><br>"A winglike brow raised up at the passion of her speech. "If the shoe fits," he murmured, then stunned her by grabbing her arm and pulling her with him.<br><br>"Just what are you doing?" Lindsay demanded, trying for imperviousness and ending on a squeak.<br><br>"Getting out of this damn downpour." He opened the car door on the driver's side and shoved her, without ceremony, inside. Automatically, Lindsay scooted across the seat to accommodate him. "I can hardly leave you out in the rain." His tone was brusque as he moved in beside her at the wheel and slammed the door behind him. The storm battered against the windows.<br><br>He dragged his fingers through the thick hank of hair that was now plastered against his forehead, and Lindsay was immediately taken with his hand. It had the wide palm and long-fingered extension of a pianist. She almost felt sympathy for his predicament. But then he turned his head. The look was enough to erase any empathy.<br><br>"Where were you going?" he asked. The question was curt, as though it had been put to a child. Lindsay straightened her wet, chilled shoulders.<br><br>"Home, about a mile straight down this road."<br><br>The brows lifted again as he took a good, long look at her. Her hair hung limp and straight around her face. Her lashes were darkened and curled without the aid of mascara, framing eyes almost shockingly blue. Her mouth pouted, but it obviously did not belong to the child he had first taken her for. Though unpainted, it was clearly a woman's mouth. The naked face had something beyond simple beauty, but before he could define it, Lindsay shivered, distracting him.<br><br>"If you're going to go out in the rain," he said mildly as he reached toward the back seat, "you should take care to dress for it."He tossed a tan jacket into her lap.<br><br>"I don't need..." Lindsay began, only to break off by sneezing twice. Teeth clenched, she slipped her arms into the jacket as he started the engine. They drove in silence with the rain drumming on the roof.<br><br>It occurred to Lindsay all at once that the man was a total stranger. She knew virtually everyone in the small seacoast town by name or by sight, but never had she seen this man. She would hardly have forgotten that face. It was easy, in the slow-moving, friendly atmosphere of Cliffside, to be casual, but Lindsay had also spent several years in New York. She knew the very real dangers of accepting rides from strangers. Surreptitiously, she inched closer to the passenger door.<br><br>"A bit late to think of that now," he said quietly.<br><br>Lindsay's head snapped around. She thought, but couldn't be certain, that his mouth lifted slightly at the corner. She angled her chin. "Just there," she said coolly, pointing to the left. "The cedar house with the dormers."<br><br>The car purred to a halt in front of a white picket fence. Pulling together all her dignity, Lindsay turned to him again. She fully intended to make her thanks frosty.<br><br>"You'd better get out of those wet clothes," he advised before she could speak. "And next time, look both ways before you cross the street."<br><br>She could only make a strangled sound of fury as she fumbled for the door handle. Stepping back into the torrent of rain, she glared across the seat. "Thanks heaps," she snapped and slammed the door peevishly. She dashed around the back of the car and through the gate, forgetting she still wore a stranger's jacket.<br><br>Lindsay stormed into the house. With her temper still simmering, she stood quite still, eyes shut, calling herself to order. The incident had been infuriating, outrageously so, but the last thing she wanted was to have to relate the entire story to her mother. Lindsay was aware that her face was too expressive, her eyes too revealing. Her tendency to so visibly express her feelings had been only another asset in her career. When she danced <i>Giselle, </i>she felt as Giselle. The audience could read the tragedy on Lindsay's face. When she danced, she became utterly rapt in the story and in the music. But when her ballet shoes came off and she was Lindsay Dunne again, she knew it was not wise to let her thoughts shout from her eyes. <br><br>If she saw that Lindsay was upset, Mae would question her and demand a detailed account, only to criticize in the end. At the moment, the last thing that Lindsay wanted was a lecture. <br><br></p><h2>Possession: A Romance (Modern Library)</h2><p><br>Hailed by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> as "a gifted observer, able to discern the exact details that bring whole worlds into being" and "a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for a thousand and one nights," A. S. Byatt writes some of the most engaging and skillful novels of our time. <i>Time</i> magazine calls her "a novelist of dazzling inventiveness."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><b>Possession</b>, for which Byatt won England's prestigious Booker Prize, was praised by critics on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1990. "On academic rivalry and obsession, Byatt is delicious. On the nature of possession&#x2014;the lover by the beloved, the biographer by his subject&#x2014;she is profound," said <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London). The <i>New Yorker</i> dubbed it "more fun to read than <i>The Name of the Rose</i> . . . Its prankish verve [and] monstrous richness of detail [make for] a one-woman variety show of literary styles and types." The novel traces a pair of young academics&#x2014;Roland Michell and Maud Bailey&#x2014;as they uncover a clandestine love affair between two long-dead Victorian poets. Interwoven in a mesmerizing pastiche are love letters and fairytales, extracts from biographies and scholarly accounts, creating a sensuous and utterly delightful novel of ideas and passions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>With an Introduction by the author that describes the novel's origins and its twenty-year gestation, this Modern Library edition is a handsome keepsake for fans of <b>Possession</b>&#x2014;new and old alike.</p><p>"Literary critics make natural detectives," says Maud Bailey, heroine of a mystery where the clues lurk in university libraries, old letters, and dusty journals. Together with Roland Michell, a fellow academic and accidental sleuth, Maud discovers a love affair between the two Victorian writers the pair has dedicated their lives to studying: Randolph Ash, a literary great long assumed to be a devoted and faithful husband, and Christabel La Motte, a lesser-known "fairy poetess" and chaste spinster. At first, Roland and Maud's discovery threatens only to alter the direction of their research, but as they unearth the truth about the long-forgotten romance, their involvement becomes increasingly urgent and personal. Desperately concealing their purpose from competing researchers, they embark on a journey that pulls each of them from solitude and loneliness, challenges the most basic assumptions they hold about themselves, and uncovers their unique entitlement to the secret of Ash and La Motte's passion. <p> Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize--the U.K.'s highest literary award--<i>Possession</i> is a gripping and compulsively readable novel. A.S. Byatt exquisitely renders a setting rich in detail and texture. Her lush imagery weaves together the dual worlds that appear throughout the novel--the worlds of the mind and the senses, of male and female, of darkness and light, of truth and imagination--into an enchanted and unforgettable tale of love and intrigue. <i>--Lisa Whipple</i></p><br>"Byatt is the most formidably equipped of contemporary novelists. . . . The great merit of [her] writing . . . is that it continually engages the reader's mind."<br>---<i>The Daily Telegraph </i><br>"This cerebral extravaganza of a story zigzags with unembarrassed zest across an imaginative terrain bristling with symbolism and symmetries, shimmering with myth and legend, and haunted everywhere by presences of the past. . . . Possession is eloquent about the intense pleasures of reading. And, with sumptuous artistry, it provides a feast of them."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---<i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)<br></p><h2>Number SENSE: Simple Effective Number Sense Experiences, Grades 1-2</h2><p>These 10-minute activities help students develop a sense of what numbers represent and how to use them by, exploring relationships and patterns, encouraging mental computation, recognizing equivalent representations of a number, establishing benchmarks, improving estimation skills, and exploring the idea of reasonableness.

In the same poll, Alf Wight - much better known as James Herriot, the celebrated vet - won the same accolade in a second category as an icon who had died but was still revered. This book sees the two reunited, with Bill Mitchell as the author and Alf as the main character. Alf&#39;s son Jim followed in his footsteps to become a vet and often accompanied Alf on his rounds. Both applied their veterinary skills to ailing farmstock and household pets in the Pennine dales and across the North York Moors. Bill Mitchell gathered much of his information from interviews with father and son. In compiling this fully illustrated book, Bill could not resist adding Herriot-like tales of Dales characters he met as a long-time editor of &#34;The Dalesman&#34;, in a colourful period overlapping that known to Alf.</p><p></p><h2>A Gentleman Gets Dressed Up: What to Wear, How to Wear It, and When to Wear It (Gentlemanners Book.)</h2><p><p><i>A Gentleman Gets Dressed Up</i> is not a book about style-it is a book about the rules-rules that will allow any man to feel more comfortable in the choices he makes about what he wears.

Produced between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago, this is some of the oldest known figurative art in the world. Looking at these art works provides a fascinating insight into the earliest modern minds and their capacity to express ideas symbolically through art. Over 100 objects are featured, including small but exquisite sculptures made from mammoth ivory, engraved drawings, ceramic models, decorated objects and jewellery from the age of the great painted caves. Some are celebrated masterpieces such as the Swimming Reindeer (13,000 years old), the so- called Willendorf Venus (25,000 years old), the Vogelherd Horse (32,000 years old) and the Lion Man (32,000 years old); others are lesser- known treasures from the collections of European museums. The author examines them in a new light, as works of aesthetic &#x2013; not solely archaeological &#x2013; interest, and as such forming part of an unbroken continuum of human creativity. <br>The compelling narrative is also illustrated with a wealth of images, from classical sculpture to twentieth-century painting and even contemporary advertising campaigns, which demonstrate surprising aesthetic parallels between these ancient works and familiar modern pieces. In this way, Ice Age art will bring home the point that the minds that created these objects in all their diversity and inventiveness were modern minds like our own, capable of highly sophisticated thought and expression.</p><p></p><h2>The Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth</h2><p>Introduces teens to Catholic beliefs, art, culture, and history as expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, discussing Church teachings on social issues of today and providing ideas for putting faith into action.</p><p>When the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 1992 after six years of work by the worldwide church's bishops, it was intended to spawn volumes exactly like this one. Such books, Pope John Paul II and the bishops theorized, would translate the pedantic Catechism, a collection of the beliefs and practices of the billion-member church, into language adjusted for cultural sensitivities. The authors of this handbook for teens have answered the call for such adaptations by producing a version that repackages the big book's teachings into an attractive, accessible format. Following the same outline as the Catechism, they present the doctrinal narrative in a relaxed, conversational style and intersperse it with eye-catching info-blocks. "Did You Know?" offers bits of Catholic trivia; "Live It" provides ideas for putting faith into action; "Looking Back" gives historical snapshots; "Saintly Profiles" tells about 37 interesting saints; and "Pray It!" lists prayer suggestions. Helpful appendices list patron saints and their feast days, describe Catholic prayers and devotions and give a glossary of common Catholic terms. Conservative readers will be pleased to see that the book bears the church's imprimatur and nihil obstat, assuring it is free of doctrinal error. The book's high-quality graphic design and friendly approach suit its young audience, while adults seeking more knowledge about the church may also find it appealing. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spell of New Mexico</h2><p>A rich gathering of essays that evoke the unique and mysterious appeal New Mexico has had for some of the twentieth century�&#x2019;s best-known writers.

Over the past two decades Sorel&#39;s loyal following among the readers of the Village Voice, Esquire, Atlantic, Time, Sports Illustrated and New York magazine has watched Ed Sorel draw his own special version of America - an America educated by incompetents, governed by hypocrites, and ruled by the military-industrial complex. Superpen includes some of the most scathing and hilarious of those drawings - his cartoon strips, his takeoffs on movie posters and famous pieces of art, and drawings inspired by some of the most outrageous things famous people have been quoted as saying. Though no one would suggest that Ed Sorel can leap tall buildings in a single bound, there is no question that he is dedicated to &#39;truth, justice,&#39; and perhaps even his own version of &#39;the American way.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Taro Gomi&#39;s Playful Puzzles: More than 60 guessing games, twisty mazes, logic puzzles, and more!</h2><p>Twisty mazes!

Israel Regardie was a friend and student of Crowley, and served as his personal secretary for some time. In this book, Regardie manages to write a fair and balanced view of Crowley. It is an intelligent and insightful look into Crowley's life, Magick and Mysticism. Dr. Regardie interprets all this from the wisdom of experience. A member of the Golden Dawn, O.T.O. and A.A., Regardie writes with deep insight and compassion, openly revealing his own feelings, and thus providing a unique insight into Crowley. This book is the classic biography of Crowley!</p></p><p>Israel Regardie (1907-1985) was an Adept of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and he was one of the greatest exponents of the Western Esoteric Tradition of the 20th century. He was also an initiate of Crowley&#39;s Order of the A.A., and he was a IXth degree initiate of Crowley&#39;s O.T.O. It was his aim to preserve the teachings and work of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. His success in this task has profoundly influenced occult thought. From the age of 20, Regardie worked as Crowley&#39;s personal secretary. During this period, until their bitter parting, Regardie was one of the few who knew Crowley well. He was one of the few who were qualified to provide first-hand, personal insight into the character and personality of one of the major figures in Western Magick. In addition to his extensive writings, Regardie practiced as a chiropractor and as a neo-Reichian therapist. He taught Psychiatry at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and contributed articles to many Psychology magazines."It's the best book on mysticism that I've read in ten years or more." --Alan Watts speaking to Robert Anton Wilson <p> "I avidly read this book when it was first published in 1970. What a joy it was to meet Dr. Regardie some years later and see the mischievous sparkle in his eye as he told his tales of Aleister Crowley. Regardie, a true man of action, braved ridicule and hatred in Crowley's defense when most of today's active proponents of Crowley's teaching weren't even born." --James Wasserman, author of Aleister Crowley and the Practice of the Magical Diary </p><p> "The Eye in the Triangle is essential reading material for anyone who is seriously interested in learning about the life, Magick and Mysticism of Aleister Crowley." --David Cherubim, Aleister Crowley Foundation</p></p><h2>Great American Prints 1900-1950: 138 Lithographs, Etchings and Woodcuts</h2><p>softcover</p><p></p><h2>Churches of the Valley; or, an Historical Sketch of the old Presbyterian Congregations of Cumberland and Franklin Counties in Pennsylvania</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.</p><p>This work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations.

Along many dimensions, a single flaw&#x2015;unrepresentativeness&#x2015;has detached our government from the people. And as a people, our fractured partisanship and ignorance on critical issues drive our leaders to stake out ever more extreme positions. </p><p>In <em>They Don&#x2019;t Represent Us</em>, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig charts the way in which the fundamental institutions of our democracy, including our media, respond to narrow interests rather than to the needs and wishes of the nation&#x2019;s citizenry. But the blame does not only lie with &#x201c;them&#x201d;&#x2015;Washington&#x2019;s politicians and power brokers, Lessig argues. The problem is also &#x201c;us.&#x201d; &#x201c;We the people&#x201d; are increasingly uninformed about the issues, while ubiquitous political polling exacerbates the problem, reflecting and normalizing our ignorance and feeding it back into the system as representative of our will.</p><p>What we need, Lessig contends, is a series of reforms, from governmental institutions to the public itself, including:</p><ul><li>A move immediately to public campaign funding, leading to more representative candidates</li><li>A reformed Electoral College, that gives the President a reason to represent America as a whole</li><li>A federal standard to end partisan gerrymandering in the states&nbsp;</li><li>A radically reformed Senate</li><li>A federal penalty on states that don&#x2019;t secure to their people an equal freedom to vote</li><li>Institutions that empower the people to speak in an informed and deliberative way</li></ul><p>A soul-searching and incisive examination of our failing political culture, this nonpartisan call to arms speaks to every citizen, offering a far-reaching platform for reform that could save our democracy and make it work for all of us.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School, host of the podcast <em>Another Way,&nbsp;</em>founder of <em>equalcitizens.us</em>, and&nbsp;co-founder of Creative Commons. He clerked for Judge Richard Posner on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court.

He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, and the author of ten books, including <em>Republic, Lost. </em>He lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.</p>&#x201c;Lessig is right that a representative American democracy, desirable in itself, would also solve most of the problems that now seem insoluble. It is hard to imagine a more thoughtful and appealing companion in the hard work to move our system to where it ought to be: in our own hands.&#x201d; (Timothy Snyder, bestselling author of <em>On Tyranny</em> and <em>The Road to Unfreedom</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig, a leading proponent of campaign finance reform, now aims at something even bigger: fixing our broken system of representative democracy. This book is brimming with promising and provocative proposals to fix campaign finance, gerrymandering, the electoral college, the filibuster, and the mind-numbing effects of cable news and social media. It is a bold and bracing repair manual for government of, by, and for the people.&#x201d; (Michael J. Sandel, bestselling author of <em>What Money Can&#x2019;t Buy</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig is a modern-day Paul Revere with a warning we must heed: Our representative democracy no longer represents us. The change we need is deep and serious. And it can&#x2019;t be fixed with by one election, party, or politician. This urgent book offers not only a clear-eyed explanation of the forces that broke our politics, but a thoughtful and, yes, patriotic vision of how we create a government that&#x2019;s truly by and for the people. We ignore his alarm at our own peril.&#x201d; (David Daley, bestselling author of <em>Ratf**ked </em>and <em>Unrigged</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Everything Lessig writes should be carefully read. Read it, consider it, and most important, act on it. Our democracy is at stake.&#x201d; (Nancy MacLean, bestselling author of <em>Democracy in Chains</em><em></em>)<br><br>&#x201c;The American experiment in representative government is on life support.&nbsp;In his brilliant book, Lessig provides the medical record and a recommended course of care to save the patient.&nbsp; Every American should read it ... stat!&#x201d; (Roger McNamee bestselling author of <em>Zucked</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Full of original, provocative insights and surprising stories, this book is for all who seek to create effective democracy in America.&#x201d; (Frances Moore Lapp�, bestselling author of <em>Diet for a Small Planet</em> and coauthor with Adam Eichen of <em>Daring Democracy.</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig proposes the making of a nonpartisan politics to breathe life into the corpse of America&#x2019;s dysfunctional democracy. He does so with fierce and plainspoken clarity. A challenging work of the political imagination, unsweetened with pious cant.&#x201d; (Lewis H. Lapham, editor and founder of <em>Lapham&#x2019;s Quarterly</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig is the thinking man&#x2019;s popular reformer and this book is a powerful, patriotic and above all useful guide to the fixes for American representative democracy.&nbsp;Agree or disagree, it every citizen should read this book.&#x201d; (Tim Wu, bestselling author of <em>The Curse of Bigness</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig shines as one of democracy&#x2019;s most passionate and complex thinkers. With spare prose and relentless reasoning, he combines the vision of a true seer, deep knowledge of the American Constitution, the laser focus of a neurosurgeon, and the practical sensibilities of the world&#x2019;s best car mechanic. Lessig inspires the realization that a more democratic future is both necessary and possible. His book is a love letter to the American people and a down-to-earth blueprint of an evolving future in which we work together to fulfill the promise of humanity&#x2019;s most important idea: We the people are endowed with the inalienable right to rule ourselves, free from the tyranny of kings, dictators, plutocrats, or computers.&#x201d; (Shoshana Zuboff, bestselling author of <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> and Professor Emerita, Harvard Business School)<br><br>&#x201c;Lessig has long been the leading voice on how corruption undermines American democracy. In this book, he trains his trademark wit and incisiveness on an even bigger problem: Our political institutions, he shows, are deeply unrepresentative. Thankfully, Lessig has an original plan for how to build on the principles of the Founding Fathers to make our institutions serve all Americans.&#x201d; (Yascha Mounk, author of <em>The People vs. Democracy</em>)</p><h2>The Joy of Cooking: Single-Volume Edition</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Four more times, in 1880, 1881, 1890, and 1899, he was drawn back to this land of rivers and glaciers, sunsets and northern lights, campfires and Arctic stars. Few people have lived so many adventures, yet Muir was not a mere collector of adventure; the hazards he encountered - and many were spine-tingling - came as a result of his intense desire to examine new aspects of the natural world.</p><p>Take a trip to last century&#39;s Alaska through Muir&#39;s clean, easy-going, enthusiastic prose. He wrote the way he took pictures, with insight, attention, care and genuine feeling. It&#39;s a lovely look into a beautiful land and its inhabitants the way it used to be, told in a flowing narrative that is far less rushed than contemporary travel tales.Smitten with Muir&#39;s compelling story, a team of experts was assembled to create this unique audio production.

This ceremony is integrally related to the hope for rain, calling it down from the sky. Inevitably, the book will be compared to Verna Aardema's Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain (Dial, 1981). While the latter is superior both in text and illustrations, it complements Moreillon's book. Aardema's story is a porquoi tale, while this is a celebration of a culture's traditions. The opportunity presented for cross-cultural comparison is fertile indeed. Used with Brenda Guiberson's Cactus Hotel (Holt, 1991), it could also be used to help explain the human role in desert ecology while focusing on that most amazing of desert plants, the Saguaro cactus. A pairing with Ekkehart Malotki's The Magic Hummingbird (Kiva, 1996) serves to reinforce the importance of rain to the Native cultures of the Southwest. Chiago makes expert use of black line to delineate his human figures, but the real strength of his watercolor illustrations lies in his treatment of the skies. His use of deep tones and cottonball clouds is reminiscent of Barbara Cooney's art.

Tour.</p><p>An expos&#x201a; of the Old Master laundering and antiquities smuggling that hide like pentimenti underneath the prestigious Sotheby's image--a story recently reported on 60 Minutes. Watson's revelatory investigations arrive opportunely, as the big auction houses are enjoying record sales and dodging government inquiries in both America and England. Sotheby's set itself up for whistle-blowing in 1989 when they laid off James Hodges, a not-too honest administrator in their London antiquities department. After Sotheby's later accused him of theft, forgery, and embezzlement, he went to Watson with three suitcases full of papers he'd accumulated over his tenure there, which showed his former employer to be deeply involved in questionable, if not outright criminal, behavior. In 1991 a jury found Hodges guilty of theft (a missing ancient helmet and bowl were in his possession), but he had provided Watson with a well-documented glimpse of Sotheby's shadier business dealings. The company did not simply fail to examine dealers' credentials and titles of ownership, but actually colluded in the act of smuggling paintings from Italy, pottery from Greece, and statuary from India, actions requiring false identities, secret bank accounts, tax evasion, and bribery. Watson went on to considerably broaden the scope of his investigation. Like his The Caravaggio Conspiracy (1985), this book includes episodes that seem to come right out of a Frederick Forsyth plot, such as Watson's participation in a nighttime police raid on Italian tomb robbers and his assumption of a false identity to probe a Delhi ``dealer.'' His pi&#x160;ce de r&#x201a;sistance details an elaborate sting in which he and some partners purchased an Old Master painting in Italy and presented it to Sotheby's there for sale. The house, deciding that the painting would fetch more at an auction in London, colluded, Watson claims, in moving the work illegally out of Italy. Part insider's investigation and part true-crime tale, Watson's work is a timely, shocking, and compelling look at the seamy underside of the trade in art and artifacts. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The sometimes shady world of the international art market has become a popular subject for writers and television reporters. Stolen treasures, smuggled antiquities, and the seemingly endless cultural atrocities of World War II have been covered in a spate of recent works. Watson, a journalist and author of the art-crime work The Caravaggio Conspiracy (LJ 2/1/84), here turns the harsh light of publicity on the elite auction rooms of Sotheby's. Using information from a former Sotheby's employee and the familiar, if sometimes distasteful tactics of investigative reporting, Watson builds a case that the auction house has systemically abetted the transportation of antiquities and Old Masters in contravention of various national and international laws. Cultural property has been questionably expatriated since the time of the Babylonian Empire. Watson's work makes a strong case that the world needs to adhere to new rules and that auction houses, collectors, and museums can lead the way. Not a comprehensive history of the great auction house but an important story that will not appear in more "official" histories.

He is also a highly respected arranger and composer, the co-author of one of the enduring seasonal classics, "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)." And were that not enough, he is also an accomplished writer, having penned, among other books, a moving biography of his close friend, drummer Buddy Rich, <em>Traps, the Drum Wonder</em>; and an unblinking portrait of Judy Garland late in her career, <em>The Other Side of the Rainbow</em>. Now, in <em>My</em> <em>Singing Teachers</em>, Torm� sums up his vast experience in a tour of American music that is spiced with insightful commentary, vivid anecdotes, and Torm�'s own take on the art of the song.<br> Here is a pantheon of popular music and jazz, a sweeping look at American song from the perspective of one of its great practitioners. Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer, Ethel Waters and Nat "King" Cole, and many many more--all in one way or another helped Torm� shape his inimitable style. Torm� has drawn inspiration from virtually every corner of the entertainment world, so the book has an enormous range--covering jazz, big band singers (such as Helen Forrest or Bob Eberly), Hollywood musical singers (such as Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin), even cowboy singers (Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, among others), not to mention lyricists, composers, and arrangers. It brims with personal anecdotes and astute observations about the greats of American music, and reveals how they have influenced his craft. For instance, Torm� recounts how, at age five, he first saw Bessie Smith in a one-reeler "The St Louis Blues" and how she still influences his blues singing. He reveals how playing at the Paramount with Ella Fitzgerald converted him from bobby-sox music to jazz. And most surprisingly, he shows how listening to instrumentalists such as Ben Webster on tenor sax and Roy Eldridge on trumpet shaped his scat singing--even more than listening to the great scat singers. Torm� also pays homage to many lesser known figures, such as composer Harry Warren--whose songs include "I Only Have Eyes for You," "The More I See You," "We're in the Money," and "Down Argentine Way"--and singer Connee Boswell, who was an important model for Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Torme himself. Perhaps most important, Torm� concludes with a chapter that captures his thoughts on singing, a section that every singer will find invaluable.<br> American popular music has been graced with many talented men and women whose wit, intellect, ingenuity, and craftsmanship have made this music immortal. <em>My Music Teachers</em> pays homage to these remarkable people as it celebrates the glories of the American song. All fans of pop or jazz, and especially all fans of Mel Torm�, will find this book a treasure.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Mel Torm�</strong> is universally recognized as one of the great jazz vocalists living today. He is the author of six books, including <em>The Other Side of the Rainbow</em> and <em>Traps, the Drum Wonder</em>.<br>Great idea: Take one of America's top jazz singers, who also happens to be a good writer (Traps, the Drum Wonder, 1991), and have him write about the singers and musicians who influenced him. Unfortunately, the end result is disappointing and frustrating. Torm&#x201a; had the good fortune to grow up in an era of great singers, songwriters, arrangers, and instrumentalists. More important, it was also an era of live radio broadcasts and increased fidelity in recording techniques. As he makes abundantly clear in this text, the phonograph was his conservatory, with radio serving as a practicum and the movies and Broadway as sources of extra-credit assignments. As a result, the influences on his musical style range far and wide, from Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald to Mabel Mercer and sax players Georgie Auld and Gerry Mulligan. In the book's best moments, he deftly describes a singer's style in a few quick brushstrokes; his descriptions of Louis Armstrong on a bandstand or Crosby at a mike are little gems that capture a moment and a style. However, too much space in this slender volume is wasted on biographical data or irrelevancies like a long list of people who dubbed vocals for Hollywood's non- singers. Torm&#x201a; is capable of better, more extended analysis, as the excellent section on the underappreciated Lee Wiley shows. He is also a pretty fair prose stylist, despite a glaring mixed metaphor in his discussion of Richard Rodgers, whose ``iron-clad melodies...stuck to your ribs.'' That sounds like a painful experience indeed. This book would have been much better if Torm&#x201a; had concentrated more on the music. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

O'Brian has always guarded the secrets of his personal history with a zealousness that has bordered on the obsessive. And for years his fanatical readers have speculated on the true story and spun myths about his past based on the lives of his characters.<br><br>Dean King at last unveils the story of Richard Patrick Russ, a writer and intellectual who emerged from the Second World War as Patrick O'Brian, a persona created in his own imagination and later refined by decades of rumor and speculation. What motivated this radical change of identity? Was it connected to O'Brian's service during the war, or the messy divorce from his first wife? Or was it the inexplicable act of an eccentric genius?King has crisscrossed Europe to speak to long-lost relatives, friends, and colleagues of his famously reclusive subject and has fashioned this wealth of information into a dramatic narrative that will appeal to an audience far wider than O'Brian's already dedicated fans.<br></p><p>Hailed as the Irish author of "the greatest historical novels ever written"--the 20 swashbuckling Napoleonic-era adventures starring Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin--Patrick O'Brian was not such a great guy. In fact, he wasn't really Patrick O'Brian: he was actually the Englishman Richard Patrick Russ, who abandoned his semiliterate Welsh wife and dying, spina bifida-plagued child in 1940 and reinvented himself as a writer and as a human being. He did well as a writer, winning kudos as a biographer (<i>Picasso</i>), translator (<i>Papillon</i>), and old literary sea lion. But he was less than humane, as Dean King's <i>A Life Revealed</i> reveals. The son of a rotten father, Russ/O'Brian became a rotten father himself, cutting off all contact with his son, granddaughters, and even siblings. As he chillingly wrote in his biography, "Parents are supposed to love their children, yet surely there is the implied condition that the children should be reasonably lovable?" Though he was kinder to his second wife, the Countess Mary Tolstoy, whose reckless driving injured both of them, he once wrote that Picasso was "sucked dry and rendered sterile by women, children, routine." For his part, O'Brian preferred poverty and exile in Southern France with Mary--remote from his family origins, penning masterpieces in a house with books but no electricity or running water. Only in his 70s did he become rich and famous.<p> You can't deny the many striking parallels between O'Brian's life and his work--even though <i>he</i> did. Rotten fathers permeate his fiction, as the fathomless woe must have permeated him upon his mother's death from tuberculosis in 1918, when he was 4. It's great fun to read about his mad-inventor father's machine to cure VD by electrocuting the bladder and compare it to Maturin's practice and devices--and to hear about the future author's salty Uncle Morse telling the lad about encounters with pirates. Captain Aubrey clearly derives partly from Patrick's sociable man-of-action brother Mike (who changed his surname to O'Brien, another family defector). And of course Maturin proves to be in large part a self-portrait.</p><p> Fans of Aubrey and Maturin may find King's <i>A Sea of Words</i> (a lexicon of arcane terms that O'Brian uses) more delightful than his expos� of O'Brian's impressive yet appalling life, but it is one thorough and convincing expos�. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>This was one of the most rewarding books I have written. Having set out to write simply an honest and respectful biography of an author I consider to be one of the great fiction writers of the last half century (as well as an otherwise important translator, writer of nonfiction and all-around man of letters), I discovered that he wasn&#39;t exactly who he led the world to believe he was. The chain of events that led me to this realization included a research trip to Ireland to the records in Dublin and to the town I was led to believe he was from (but wasn&#39;t) and journeys to North Wales and Catalan France. I was soon on the trail of the true story behind the author, and while that story is full of struggle, pain, regret and metamorphosis, it in no way diminished my respect for the man and love for the body of work he produced, namely the Aubrey-Maturin novel series. And, in fact, I came to realize that it is impossible to fully understand and comprehend these rich novels and their beloved characters without knowing and understanding the underlying details of O&#39;Brian&#39;s life. These I lay out for the reader and contextualize in this biography as best I could, given that O&#39;Brian and most of his immediate family were still in denial about his true life story. In the process of writing this book, I nonetheless met much of his son, his one-time best friend, and extended family and even connected them across continents in real life. For this opportunity, I will be ever grateful. I hope the story in this biography enriches your readings and rereadings of the Aubrey-Maturin novels as it has mine.</p><h2>Murder in the City of Liberty (A Van Buren and DeLuca Mystery)</h2><p><p><strong>Hamish DeLuca and Regina &#x201c;Reggie&#x201d; Van Buren have a new case&#x2014;and this one could demand a price they&#x2019;re not willing to pay.</strong></p><p>Determined to make a life for herself, Reggie Van Buren bid goodbye to fine china and the man her parents expected her to marry and escaped to Boston.

Modern history (his story) may have buried the Great Goddess under suffocating layers of denial and revisionism, yet as we move deeper into the "sophianic millennium," scraping away the fallow ground of patriarchy, She emerges anew. Author Caitlin Matthews unveils the veiled Black Goddess (the primal manifestation of the Divine Feminine) in her many hiding places over the last several thousand years. Disempowered and hacked to pieces, she has survived in the major Western religions, philosophies, and mystery schools in many guises. With the aid of the author's trained and intuitive eye, the reader tracks Her faint footsteps through the long dark night of the feminine soul. Along with <i>The White Goddess</i> by Robert Graves, this book is a must-read for those who wish to understand why the Goddess fled, where She went, and how we can reaffirm Her as the giver of practical and spiritual wisdom--celebrating Her primacy in the manifestation of all things. <i>--P.

Among the uneasy novitiates that day were John Marian Poindexter and John Sidney McCain III. Four years later, the Class of '58 had been whittled down by 25 percent. Of the 899 survivors, Poindexter, a small-town banker's son from landlocked Indiana, stood number one in the class. As a senior, he wore the six stripes of the brigade commander, the top leadership post at Annapolis. McCain, the scion of one of the most illustrious families in the annals of the Navy, stood 894, fifth from the bottom. He never smelled a stripe.<br><br>The two Johns had little in common beyond their first names, McCain rowdy, raunchy, a classic underachiever ambivalent about his presence at Annapolis; Poindexter cool, contained, a young man at the top of his game who knew from the start that he belonged at the Academy. In neighboring Bancroft Hall companies, they were neither friends nor enemies. They moved along paths that rarely intersected, Poindexter walking on water, McCain scraping the ocean floor, a bottom feeder, at least academically.<br><br>There was one important similarity. Both McCain and Poindexter were leaders in the class, the former in a manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way, the latter in a cerebral, understated manner that was no less forceful for its subtlety. As the Academy was fully capable of accommodating both leadership styles, they might easily have found themselves competing for top positions within the Brigade. But little else was equal. "John Poindexter was the sort of guy with a halo around his head," said classmate Bill Hemingway. "McCain was the one with the horns." Hemingway was Poindexter's roommate, but not even McCain would contest the point.<br><br>John McCain always knew he was going to Annapolis, knew it with such unshakable finality that he never really thought twice about it, at least not seriously. It was part of the air he breathed, the ether through which he moved, the single immutable element in his life. He was the grandson of Admiral John Sidney "Slew" McCain, '06, a high-strung, irascible old sea dog who fought the Japanese with Bull Halsey from Guadalcanal to Tokyo Bay, watched them surrender on the deck of the battleship <i>Missouri,</i> then dropped dead four days later. The <i>New York Times</i> reported his death on its front page.<br><br>The Annapolis tradition continued with John's father, John Sidney McCain, Jr., '31, called Jack, at times Junior, a salty World War II submarine skipper climbing steadily toward flag rank himself. He was known for his trademark cigar, promotion of seapower, and devilish reply when asked how he could tell his wife, a college homecoming queen, and her twin sister apart. "That's their problem," he harrumphed.<br><br>Though resigned to Annapolis, John was not happy about it and at times seemed intent on sabotaging his chances for admission. Rebellious by nature, he viewed rules and regulations through a highly personal prism, as challenges to his wit and ingenuity. At Episcopal High School, a private boarding school for boys in Alexandria, Virginia, those qualities emerged with a vengeance.<br><br>He was known as Punk, alternatively as Nasty, in another variation, McNasty. He cultivated the image. The Episcopal yearbook pictures him in a trench coat, collar up, cigarette dangling Bogart-style from his lips. That pose, if hardly the impression Episcopal hoped to project, at least had a world-weary panache to it. Generally, though, he mocked the school's dress code by wearing blue jeans with his coat and tie and otherwise affecting a screw-you raffishness. He would later describe himself in those days as a rebel without a cause, a James Dean type, though it's just as easy to imagine him as Holden Caulfield, red hunting hat askew, railing about phonies, sneaking cigarettes, driving old Ackley-kid crazy.<br><br>One of his few friends, Malcolm Matheson, remembered him fondly as "a hard-rock kind of guy, a tough, mean little fucker." One time he was hauled into juvenile court after he leaned from the window of a friend's car to berate two older girls with the words "Shove it up your ass" when they ridiculed his awkward pickup attempts.<br><br>He dealt with the inevitability of Annapolis like a man loath to take the painful actions necessary to break an unhappy engagement. Rather than telling his parents what he really thought -- screw Annap-olis, the place sucks -- he put himself in a variety of compromising situations, seemingly hoping that the word would filter back so they would take the initiative, leaving him guilt-ridden but free to attend the school of his choice, which meant just about anywhere else.<br><br>McCain never went so far in his peccadilloes, however, as to subvert his birthright. He was defiant and flouted the rules, but given his pedigree it would have taken the hand of God to transform his childish pranks and boyish transgressions into something serious enough to bar him from Annapolis. And God, it seems, was otherwise occupied or knew something about McCain that McCain didn't. And so, on an early summer's day in 1954, in a car driven by his father, John journeyed to Annapolis, raised his right hand, and marched joylessly into his future.<br><br>To his surprise, he enjoyed plebe summer, thriving on the physical activity and drill. To Ron Thunman, the newly commissioned ensign in charge of his summer company, McCain displayed a dynamic quality, a scrappiness, that revealed itself most clearly in the plebe summer boxing smokers. Unschooled as a boxer, McCain would charge to the center of the ring and throw punches until someone went down. That summer it was always the other guy. He won all his fights by knockouts or TKOs.<br><br>His fortunes took a downward turn when the upper three classes returned in September. The least docile of plebes, he refused to accept the notion that someone could demean and degrade him simply because he had been at Annapolis two or three years longer. As he saw it, a lot of guys who had never done anything in their lives suddenly had the power to make his life miserable. "It was bullshit, and I resented the hell out of it," he later said.<br><br>As at Episcopal, he reacted by challenging the system, quickly piling up demerits. Shoes unshined, late for formation, talking in ranks, room in disorder, gear improperly stowed. Academically, he spent time, not a lot, on the courses he liked -- English, history, and government -- ignoring the rest, about 75 percent of the curriculum.<br><br>He treated the system throughout his four years like a hostile organism, something to beat back, keep at bay, as if any compromise meant surrendering a part of himself that he might never retrieve. John McCain at Annapolis, however, was not the John McCain of Episcopal days. He shed the punk image and became one of the most popular midshipmen in his class, if one of the least conventional.<br><br>He proved to be a natural leader, his magnetic personality making him the unofficial trail boss for a lusty band of carousers and partygoers known as the Bad Bunch. "People kind of gravitated to him," said Chuck Larson. "They would respond to his lead. They pretty much cared about his approval and they cared about what he thought." Larson, an ex-officio member of the Bad Bunch, was McCain's closest friend at the Academy and for some years after. They were known as the Odd Couple, McCain short, scrappy, the consummate screwup, Larson the model midshipman, tall, handsome, smooth, bright. They shared a sense of the absurd and an eye for the ladies. Larson, though, was cautious. Of course, he had more to be cautious about. McCain didn't know what the word meant. As one classmate put it, being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck.<br><br>Even so, his classmates clustered around him, followed his lead, a modern-day Pied Piper decked out in Navy blue. "Whatever John would suggest that we do, whether it was at the Academy or on liberty, I tended to follow," said classmate Jack Dittrick. "And I don't think I was alone in that. I've talked with other classmates and we all marvel at how much control John had over what we did."<br><br>He lived on the edge, which only added to his popularity. Even if you held back a bit, followed him so far and no further like Chuck Larson, it was still a hell of a ride.<br><br>One night McCain led the Bad Bunch over the wall to a watermen's bar on a small creek outside Annapolis. The place was little more than a screened-in shack with sawdust on the floor and an electric shuffleboard machine in the corner. Its appeal lay in a feature close to the heart of real estate agents and thirsty midshipmen alike: location. The bar was situated about an eighth of a mile beyond the seven-mile limit, within which midshipmen could not be served alcohol. The catch was that midshipmen on liberty were not permitted to wander beyond the seven-mile limit.<br><br>Two dozen midshipmen were drinking alongside the bar's usual clientele of fishermen and crabbers when the Shore Patrol burst through the door. "Nobody move," shouted the officer in charge, triggering a mad dash for freedom. Midshipmen crashed through the mesh screens that passed for walls and scurried into the surrounding woods, tearing their clothes, losing their caps. Some reversed field, hid in boats tied to the dock across from the bar. Others huddled in ditches or behind fences. McCain and a couple of buddies were sprinting down a road when a car slowed alongside them. "Get in," said the driver, laughing like crazy. He turned out to be a recent Academy graduate showing his girlfriend one of his old haunts. After dropping McCain and his friends in Annapolis, he returned to the bar and picked up another carload of mids. Everyone made it back one way or the other, hitching rides, scooting over the wall, slipping into Bancroft through any open window they could find.<br><br>No one ever had to give John Poindexter a midnight ride back to Annapolis. Bucking the system was not his style. "John lived a complete life at the Academy," said classmate Whit Swain. "He had everything he wanted. He didn't have to go over the wall. He didn't need that challenge. He didn't need to escape from anything."<br><br>Poindexter was comfortable with the system from the start. He took his share of abuse as a fourth classman, but seldom became rattied, swiftly establishing his credentials as a big-timer. Less adroit plebes groused that upperclassmen seemed almost respectful when hazing him. On those rare occasions when they turned on him, the reaction of his classmates was curious. He must be something special if they're working him over like that, they marveled, as if unable to imagine him doing anything wrong.<br><br>In truth, he rarely did. Ellen Poindexter, with affection and a trace of awe, says of her son, "John was never a little boy. He was born an old man." Her comment recalled political adman Roger Ailes's description of the young Richard Nixon as the kid who carried a briefcase to school and never let anyone copy his homework. But that wasn't John Poindexter. Growing up, he was bright, orderly, and competent, friendly and fun-loving as well. He was also wellliked, a notable achievement for a kid lacking athletic prowess to temper the teenage curse of superior intelligence. His classmates nicknamed him Brain, but affirmed his popularity by electing him King of the Fall Festival, the annual harvest celebration at his tiny high school in Odon, a southwest Indiana town described by Knight-Ridder correspondent Ellen Warren as a no-stoplight rural clich�.<br><br>Marlan and Ellen Poindexter, with just a year of college between them, encouraged John and their three younger children to high academic achievement. They also provided a supportive environment in which the abilities of their offspring bloomed. But John, the oldest, was a self-starter, destined for a life of consummate excellence, if not dazzling brilliance, from the day he was born in 1936.<br><br>Another ingredient in his personality contributed to his success. From childhood on, at least until he reached the White House, he recognized his limits and resisted the temptation to reach beyond them. "I don't do things I don't do well," he once confided to an acquaintance.<br><br>John was an avid Boy Scout, winning induction into the select Order of the Arrow, a scouting fraternity that stresses character, fortitude, and self-reliance. He and his rogue cousin Dickie Ray Poindexter were in the same Scout troop, but viewed their responsibilities to the younger boys in sharply different ways. "My idea was when you brought Tenderfoots in we'd take their pants off and paint their dicks with Mercurochrome," said Dickie Ray. "John's attitude was to sit them down and teach them how to go through the Boy Scout manual and how a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.<br><br>There were few surface similarities between Marian Poindexter, a hard-driving, at times abrasive small-town banker, and his oldest son, an engaging kid who made everything he did look easy and displayed no special interest in material wealth, then or later. Their differences, however, obscured significant likenesses. Both had well-defined career paths laid out for them -- Marian in the family funeral home business, John in banking -- but each chose to strike off in new, unfamiliar directions. They also shared a quiet self-assurance, as if sensing in themselves a special quality destined to bring success if they just trusted their instincts.<br><br>Marlan prospered as a banker because he never forgot the marketing skills he developed years earlier peddling Kirby and Regina vacuum cleaners door-to-door. Even so, business would never have mushroomed as it did in the 1950s if not for Marian's genius in recognizing opportunity in the opening of the sprawling naval weapons facility in nearby Crane.<br><br>Tightfisted with his homegrown customers, Marian cultivated the men and women stationed at Crane, setting up check-cashing booths on the base on payday, offering free checking services, most importantly providing servicemen, especially officers, with easy loan approval, often solely on their signatures. "Marian learned early on that when you do business with the Navy, the Navy makes you pay your bills, especially if you're a career officer," said his nephew, Dickie Ray.<br><br>By the early 1960s, ads for his bank having followed John to Annapolis, the elder Poindexter was on a first-name basis with naval officers all over the world, for whom the phrase "banking with Marlan" had come to mean unstinting personal service. They'd call the little bank at the corner of Spring and Main, tell Marian they needed a loan, and he'd okay it over the phone. If they ran short of funds some months, Marian told them not to worry, he'd transfer money into their accounts, comfortable in the knowledge that their allotment checks would arrive in a few days. "Thanks," he'd write on their deposit slips. "Glad to see you're in Naples." Military families driving through Indiana sometimes made a sidetrip to Odon just to meet Marlan face-to-face.<br><br>John began talking about the Naval Academy during his junior year in high school. He had never seen the ocean, but tales of the seafaring life spun by such writers as C. S. Forester and Jack London had fired his imagination. Coming of age in a world of winter wheat and small-town ambitions, he was a closet romantic, a latter-day Horatio Hornblower craving adventure, as susceptible to the tug of the sea as a politician to the charm of a big-bucks campaign contributor.<br><br>At Annapolis, he started w...</p><h2>The Morning Star Trilogy</h2><p>The second half of the best-selling Griffin and Sabine saga is now available in a handsome slipcase, the companion to The Griffin &amp; Sabine Trilogy boxed set.

Ned is back. Ned and H. G.

They have saved them from drowning or possibly being killed by alien invaders. In the process of jumping from one dimension to another, trying to discover a time path home, they find themselves in an inner world with a stationary sun. It s a warm world with jungles, rivers, and land-locked seas. It is full of primitive creatures, including dinosaurs, highly intelligent apes, cannibals, strange storms and bad hygiene. Deciding on a brief picnic and minor exploration before jumping to Victorian England, Ned and his friends end up saving a famous apeman from human-eating birds, and soon set out to assist the apeman, Tango, in stealing a Golden Fleece with curative powers, a fleece skinned from the body of a strange space traveler. The fleece resides in a magnificent city, a kind of Shangri-La in the far Blue Mountains. Their plan is to use the fleece to cure Tango&#39;s beautiful wife, who has fallen into a coma. Nothing seems to cure her, but the rumored miraculous powers of the Golden Fleece just might. If the world doesn&#39;t kill them, then another survivor of the shipwreck from which Bongo Bill and Suzie Q were rescued just might.

Arguably the most established contemporary spiritual classic by our most profound living religious writer.</p><p>When Richard Foster began writing <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> more than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: "Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter." Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of "intense intimacy and awful reverence," he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate. <p> Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that "our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>In the twenty years since its publication, <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> has helped over a million seekers discover a richer spiritual life infused with joy, peace, and a deeper understanding of God. For this special twentieth-anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be. <p>Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, <i>Celebration of Discipline<i></i> explores the "classic Disciplines," or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found. </i></p><p><i>Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration bring us nearer to one another and to God. </i></p><p><i>Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities--and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and "bring the abundance of God into our lives." He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and "sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others." The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance, for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> will help Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.</i></p></p><h2>Black Lesbians: An Annotated Bibliography</h2><p>African American Studies, Gay &amp; Lesbian Studies, Homosexuality, Women's Studies, Bibliogrpahy</p><p></p><h2>Ceramics of Picasso</h2><p>The potter who was Picasso&#39;s collaborator offers an examination of the different phases of the renowned artist&#39;s work, follows Picasso&#39;s evolution in the medium, and views Picasso&#39;s ceramic output as a whole</p><p></p><h2>The Book of Phoenix</h2><p><i>A fiery spirit dances from the pages of the Great Book.

Some of them like to say that the goddess Ani wrote the Great Book and made it so that ten men and women who loved stories would find copies of it at the same time. Some of them say a mere woman with ten children transcribed Ani&#x2019;s words over ten years. Others say some illiterate half-witted farmer wrote it in one night after Ani blessed him. Most believe that the Great Book&#x2019;s author was a mad yet holy, always always holy, prophet who&#x2019;d taken refuge in a cave.</p><p>What <i>I</i> can tell you is that two hundred years after it all went wrong an old man named Sunuteel was out in the desert. This man was one of those who enjoyed being out there for weeks on end, close to the sun, sand, and desert creatures. The time away from his wife made their time together sweeter. Sunuteel and his wife agreed on this. They were old. They had wisdom.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; his wife said with a smile. She took his old rough hand into her equally rough old hand. She was a beautiful woman, and Sunuteel found it easy to look into her eyes. &#x201c;It is good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I need the solitude.&#x201d;</p><p>There had been an especially powerful Ungwa storm and the old nomadic couple had barely survived the dry thundery night of lightning. A bolt had struck near their sturdy tent, setting on fire one of the three stunted palm trees they&#x2019;d camped beside. His wife had been peeking out of the tent when it happened. Thankfully, she&#x2019;d blinked at precisely the right moment. She said the tree looked like a woman dancing in flames. Even as Sunuteel dragged her to the center of the tent where they huddled and prayed, his wife felt a presence. She was sure it was a premonition.</p><p>The old man was used to his superstitious wife and her odd intuitions. Therefore, he knew his wife would want to be alone to think and ponder and fret. When the storm passed and she gently encouraged him to take a few days to go and see what was out there, he didn&#x2019;t argue. He took the rolled up goatskin tent and satchel of supplies she handed him and kissed her on the cheek. He didn&#x2019;t say goodbye because in his tribe &#x201c;goodbyes&#x201d; were a curse.</p><p>&#x201c;I leave my <i>chi</i> to keep you company,&#x201d; he said. Each night he was away, along with her meals, she&#x2019;d prepare a small plate of food for his personal god until Sunuteel returned. He clipped his portable to his hip, facing the tiny device inside his pocket. After one last, far more prolonged kiss, he walked away from his wife. Did she think an angel was coming to visit her? His wife&#x2019;s descendants were from the Islamic portion of Old Naija. She said that her father used to tell her all sorts of stories about angels and djinn. She&#x2019;d passed these magical stories on to their own children as they grew up.</p><p>Minutes after leaving, Sunuteel brought out his portable and laughing to himself, called up the virtual screen and typed, &#x201c;Hussaina, greet <i>her</i> for me when you see her, whether she&#x2019;s an angel or djinni.&#x201d; Moments later, his wife Hussaina&#x2019;s reply popped up on the screen saying what she always said when Sunuteel went off, &#x201c;And you make sure you bring me back a good story.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, Sunuteel came upon a cave full of computers. A tomb of old old technology from the Black Days, the Times of the Dark People, the Era of the Okeke. This was one of those caves into which panicked Okeke packed thousands of computers just before Ani turned her attention back to the earth. These computers were supposedly used to store huge amounts of information separate from digital repositories called virtual spaces. Little good this did; virtual or physical, it was all dead, forgotten, rotten.</p><p>&#x201c;What am I seeing?&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Can this be?&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed a shaky hand to his chest, feeling the strong heartbeat of his strong heart. Standing here, he didn&#x2019;t feel so old. No, not old at all. This place made him feel young as a babe. Sunuteel, who was Okeke and therefore a descendant of the evil that caused the goddess Ani to bring the deserts, knew of the poisonous Black Days and their most poisonous genius gadgetry. However, he had always wanted to see these ancient computers with his own eyes.</p><p>So, he went in.</p><p>The cave was cool and it smelled of dust, mineral oil, plastic, wires, and metal. There were ghosts here and Sunuteel shivered from the thought of them. Still, he approached these old machines. <i>This</i> was a story to tell his wife. The third computer that he touched sparked with life. Terrified, he snatched his hand from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pad he&#x2019;d accidently brushed against and stumbled back. The grey hand-sized box, softly hummed. Then it spoke to the portable clipped inside the pocket of his dusty pants. The portable pinged softly as it wirelessly received a large file from the computer. Sunuteel blinked and then fled from the cave, sure a ghost had touched him.</p><p>When he made it back to his small goatskin tent beside a baobab tree, only then did he dare look at his portable. He held the coin-sized device in his palm and brought it to his face, for his eyesight was poor. He squinted at the tiny screen. Next to the file that contained messages from his wife was a black icon in the shape of a bird that seemed to be looking over its shoulder. He tapped it with the tip of his finger and a deep male voice began to speak in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. English!</p><p>It was an audio file. Sunuteel sat back in his tent, grinning with delight. <i>My goodness</i>, he thought. <i>How strange. What are the chances?! </i>He <i>knew </i>this dead language, albeit the accent was very odd, indeed. He brought up the virtual screen. The visual words that appeared as the audio file played were tinted red instead of the usual green. He put the portable on the blanket before him. Then he watched and listened.</p><p>The voice read a table of contents as it digitally projected the words on the virtual screen in front of him:</p><p>&#x201c;Section one, mythology. Section two, legend. Section three, mechanics. Section four, news&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned as it read on and on. After a while, he decided to click on &#x201c;Section thirty-eight, memory extracts&#x201d; because the phrase rung a distant bell from when he was a child. In school, the teacher had spoken about the dark times hundreds of years ago, when human beings were obsessed with the pursuit of immortality. They had even found a way to pull out and capture people&#x2019;s memories right from their minds so they could preserve them forever. &#x201c;Just like a capture station sucking condensation from the sky to make drinking water,&#x201d; his schoolteacher had said.</p><p>Sunuteel had been fascinated and quietly proud of just how <i>far</i> human beings had gotten in their technological pursuit. Nevertheless, his schoolteacher had discouraged him from further research. &#x201c;Sunuteel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This was what led us to receiving Ani&#x2019;s wrath.&#x201d;</p><p>And so the young Sunuteel turned away from the past and looked mostly toward the future. He loved language, words and stories. He&#x2019;d gone on to become one of his village&#x2019;s most valued recorders and reciters. He could recite the most beautiful poetry in five different dialects of flawless Okeke, but also in the language and various dialects of the majestic and mighty Nuru people and the common language of Sipo. And most amazingly, one of the prominent village elders had been able to teach him English, too.</p><p>As far as Sunuteel knew, this elder, an old-timer in Sunuteel&#x2019;s village who&#x2019;d always been called The Seed, was the only person who knew the language. The Seed was also the only light-skinned person in his village who was not albino. This man refused to call himself Nuru, insisting that he was &#x201c;Arab,&#x201d; a term that had long become more an insult than an ethnic description of the Nuru people. The Seed preferred to live amongst the Okeke, the dark-skinned woolly-haired people. He&#x2019;d built a house in front of one of the pyramids because it reminded him of home. When Sunuteel was a teen, The Seed looked no older than fifty, but Sunuteel&#x2019;s mother said he was actually much older.</p><p>&#x201c;He looked the exact same when I was a little girl,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told him. She was right. Even now that Sunuteel was an old old man, The Seed still looked no older than fifty. Sunuteel was of a people who understood that the world was full of mystery. Thus, a seemingly immortal man living in the village didn&#x2019;t bother anyone. The Seed had an amazing command of the English language and though he was moody and reclusive at times, he turned out to be a wonderful teacher.</p><p>Sunuteel went on to read the only two English texts in the entire region, both of which were owned by the Seed. One was an anthropology book titled <i>Virulent</i> <i>Diseases of the Mars Colonies</i>, the other a book about igneous rock sediments. Despite the dryness of the subjects, Sunuteel loved the rhythm of English. It was a liquid sounding language, due to the way the words ran together.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extracts,&#x201d; the voice announced in English. But then it began speaking another list and each item on it was in a different language, none of which he understood. Annoyed, Sunuteel listened for a while and was about to go back to the main menu when the male voice clearly said, &#x201c;Extract number 5, <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>&#x201d; in English.</p><p>He clicked on it.</p><p>At first there was a long pause and the bird icon popped on the screen. It rotated counter-clockwise. He counted thirteen rotations and when it kept going, he looked up at the sky. Blue. Clear. A large hawk-like bird flew overhead, soaring high in the sky, probably seeing him perfectly with its sharp eyes. <i>I will return to Hussaina in two days</i>, he thought. <i>That&#x2019;s enough alone time for her to stop thinking about premonitions and angels</i>. He smiled to himself. She would excitedly cook him a spicy meal of doro wat when he told her he had &#x201c;a big big tale to tell.&#x201d; She loved a good story, and good stories were best told on a full stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extract Number 5,&#x201d; the male voice suddenly announced, making Sunuteel jump. &#x201c;Title: <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>. Location Number 578.&#x201d;</p><p>And then a woman began feverishly speaking. Her soft breathy voice was like a powerful incantation, for as she spoke, it seemed that the old man&#x2019;s eyesight, which dimmed more and more every year, began to brighten. His wife would have recognized what was happening. However, Sunuteel was a man less open to such things.</p><p>Still, as he sat in his tent, gazing through the red virtual words before him and the open tent flap just beyond the words, outside into the desert, he realized he could see for miles and miles. Sweat prickled on his forehead and between the coarse hairs of his armpits. He listened. And the very first person to hear one of the many many entries from <i>The Great Book</i> was awed by the story he heard.</p><p><i>&#x201c;There is no book about me,&#x201d;</i> the voice said.<i> &#x201c;Well, not yet. No matter. I shall create it myself; it&#x2019;s better that way. To tell my tale, I will use the old African tools of story: Spoken words. They are worthier of my trust and they&#x2019;ll last longer. And during shadowy times, spoken words carry farther than words typed, imaged, or written. My beginnings were in the dark. We all dwelled in the dark, mad scientist and speciMen, alike. A dear friend of mine would say that this time was when &#x2018;the goddess Ani still slept&#x2019;. I call my story </i>The Book of Phoenix<i>. It is reliable and short, because it was accelerated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br></i></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1<br>SpeciMen</b></p><p>I&#x2019;d never known any other place. The 28th floor of Tower 7 was my home. Yesterday, I realized it was a prison, too. I probably should have suspected something. The two-hundred-year-old marble skyscraper had many dark sides to its existence and I knew most of them. There were 39 floors, and on almost every one was an abomination. I was an abomination. I&#x2019;d read many books and this was clear to me. However, this building was still my home.</p><p><i>Home</i>: a. One&#x2019;s place of residence. Yes, it was my home.</p><p>They gave me all the 3D movies I could watch, but it was the plethora of books that did it for me. A year ago, they gave me an e-reader packed with 700,000 books of all kinds. No matter the topic, I consumed those books voraciously, working my way through over half of them. When it came to information, I was given access to anything I requested. That was part of their research. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I know it now.</p><p>Research. This was what all The Towers were about. There were seven, all in American cities, yet they were not part of the American government. Not technically. If you dug for information, you would not find one governmental connection on file.</p><p>I had access to information about all the towers, and I read extensively. However, Tower 7 was where I lived, so I studied this tower the most. They gave me many &#x201c;top-secret&#x201d; files on Tower 7. As I said, I was always given what I asked for; this was part of the research. But also, they did not see me as a threat, not to them. I was a perfectly contained classified &#x201c;speciMen.&#x201d; And for a speciMen, knowledge wasn&#x2019;t power.</p><p>Tower 7 was located in Times Square on the island of Manhattan, United States of America. Much of Manhattan was underwater, but geologists were sure this part of it was stable enough for Tower 7. It was in the perfect position for top surveillance and security. I&#x2019;d read about each floor and some of the types of abominations found on them. I&#x2019;d listened to audios of the spiritual tellings of long-dead African and Native American shamans, sorcerers and wizards. I&#x2019;d read the Tanakh, the Bible, and the Koran. I studied the Buddha and meditated until I saw Krishna. And I read countless books on the sciences of the world. Carrying all this in my head, I understood abomination. I understood the purpose of Tower 7. Until yesterday.</p><p>Each tower had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specializations. In Tower 7, it was advanced and aggressive genetic manipulation and cloning. In Tower 7, people and creatures were invented, altered, or both. Some were deformed, some were mentally ill, some were just plain dangerous, and none were flawless. Yes, some of us were dangerous. I was dangerous.</p><p>Then there was the tower&#x2019;s lobby on the ground floor that projected a completely different picture. I&#x2019;d never been down there but my books described it as an earthly wonderland, full of creeping vines covering the walls and small trees growing from artistically crafted holes in the floor. In the center was the main attraction. Here grew the thing that brought people from all over the world to see the famous Tower 7 Lobby (<i>only</i> the lobby; there were no tours of the rest of the building).</p><p>A hundred years ago, one of the landscapers planted a new tree in the lobby&#x2019;s center. On a lark, some Tower 4 scientists who were there to visit the greenhouse on the ninth floor emptied an experimental solution into the tree&#x2019;s pot of soil. The substance was for enhancing and speeding up arboreal growth. The tree grew and grew. In a place where people thought like normal human beings, they would have uprooted the amazing tree and placed it outdoors.</p><p>However, this was Tower 7 where boundaries were both contained and pushed.

As Freemasons, Knights Templar, and Rosicrucians they affected the course of the French and American revolutions as well as the overthrow of the medieval order. Inevitably, the true ideals and esoteric practices of these societies have at times been perverted by self-serving individuals. The Nazis, of course, but also the British security forces, the founding fathers of America, and the Vatican have all had a part--for good or ill--in the occult conspiracy <br><br>The author explores these connections, tracing occult influences in politics and statecraft from the time of ancient Egypt to the present. He sheds light on these influences in government and in the lives of many well-known figures, including Frederick the Great, John Dee, Francis Bacon, Benjamin Franklin, Comte Cagliostro, Helen Blavatsky, Rasputin, and Woodrow Wilson. Reading <em>The Occult Conspiracy</em>, we are left with little doubt that the secret societies--largely ignored by orthodox historians and persecuted throughout history--have survived and continue to operate powerfully in world affairs today.<br></p><p>Michael Howard has been a student of secret societies and the occult for thirty years, and is an expert on Anglo-Saxon runes. He makes his home in Wales, and has conducted studies of the prehistoric stone circles of that area.<b>That Odd Mary Magdalene<br></b><br>It seems that even among Jesus&#x2019; disciples, Mary played a privileged role. Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded.<br><br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual.<br><br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God.<br><br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d;<br><br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess.<br><br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus.<br><br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman?<br><br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case!<br><br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Allie&#39;s Legacy (Thoroughbred Series #70)</h2><p><p>This 13 year old equestrian series is still running strong as it publishes it's 70th title! </p><p> When Allie came to Whisperwood and was adopted by Cindy no once expected her long&#x2013;lost relatives to come and find her.

In the 1950s he worked as a manual laborer in the Kladno ironworks, from which he drew inspiration for his &#34;hyper-realist&#34; texts he was writing at that time. He won international acclaim for such books as I Served the King of England and Too Loud a Solitude. Hrabal is considered, along with Jaroslav Hasek and Karel Capek, as one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century, and perhaps the most important in the post-war period.

Suddenly, decades of riotous fun and booming business went splat. Top music executives got evicted from their offices, some escorted by company guards. Why? The answers are in <i>Exploding</i> -- the most insightful and delightful book about the record business ever written.</p><p>In the rock explosion of the Sixties and Seventies, Warner Bros., Atlantic, and Elektra Records dominated the business as the Warner Music Group. But by the Nineties, the success of WMG was shaken by egos and corporate politics that left the company struggling for identity in a dramatically changing industry. This is the story of that long, strange trip.</p><p>Your host is the ultimate insider: Stan Cornyn, a key creative force behind the Warner Music Group's stunning rise. During more than thirty years at the company, Cornyn went through what the news media could never uncover. In a freewheeling, vastly entertaining narrative, Cornyn takes us behind the scenes, seats us in the conference rooms, and shows us the interactions between the stars and the suits -- using the same irreverent wit that produced the marketing campaigns that helped put Warner on the map.</p><p><i>Exploding</i> is populated by music stars like Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Lil' Kim, Dr. Dre, the Grateful Dead, Queen, Madonna, Ice-T, Joni Mitchell, Frank Zappa, Neil Young, Alice Cooper, and dozens more, even the legendary supergroup Scorpio. (Never heard of Scorpio? You'll find out why.) And it introduces you to the most colorful businesspeople ever: hyperintense record sellers who shave their heads; throw doves off a roof; send pig heads through the mail; provide the money, meds, and mammaries -- <i>anything</i> -- to get their records on the air. Here is the music business as you've never seen it: at its wildest, in its wackiest fifty years, bursting with hits and cash, until, by the end, it's just plain <i>Exploding.</i></p></p><p>Two-time Grammy Award winner Stan Cornyn began working at Warner Bros. Records at its birth in the late Fifties, writing liner notes for Frank Sinatra and hundreds of other acts on the Warner/Reprise roster. He spent thirty-four years with the Warner Music Group, developing creative marketing, dealing with industry threats, and leading its development of the CD and interactive media. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.When did the money become more important than the music? Cornyn, a veteran of Warner Bros. Records from its birth in the late 1950s, fondly recalls when it was about the music (and the dames and drunken fun didn't hurt), a time before such terms as "units," "product," "industry" entered the vernacular. He's frank about the people and circumstances that have forever changed the business. Also realistic, he knows changes will continue (which is why he urges readers to turn this into a "living book" by contributing their own observations online). Having spent 34 years with the company in its many incarnations, Cornyn could've chosen the route of raunchy expose, but instead he delivers good gossip with high humor and class. He describes the unknowns who stepped in and rescued Warner during down times, like Bob Newhart with his comedy album in 1962, and later Madonna. Snappy stories of artists itching to break contracts Sinatra did so with "laryngitis," the Sex Pistols with urine, Jackson Browne with tears. But even juicier, as the company history unfolds, are the insider takes on the men (and the occasional women) behind the music, the boardroom brawls, midnight calls, hush-hush deals, and talks with Teamsters. Endearingly, he freeze-frames the grander moments, when someone makes the perfect quip or sings a line just right. This music narrative has all the elements drama, mystery, comedy, a course in business (royalties, payola, severance pay), debauchery (Queen's outrageous party in New Orleans) and history. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Steaming to Bamboola: The World of a Tramp Freighter</h2><p>The author recounts his journey on a tramp steamer across the Atlantic and the colorful members of the crew he worked with</p><p></p><h2>The World&#39;s Easiest Guide to Finances</h2><p>The World&#39;s Easiest Guide to Finances [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2001] Burkett, Larry</p><p><b> LARRY BURKETT</b> (1939-2003) was a well-known authority on business and personal finance.

Its original 25 pages of illustrations have more than doubled and now include over 250 individual drawings. All of these drawings have been specially prepared for this new edition by John Goody, and all are fully labelled and annotated in the accompanying legends. The text is primarily intended to explain and in many instances to expand upon the content of the drawings. The basic make-up of the horse is considered with the "points" of the horse being shown from several different views. Bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments providing the anatomical basis for these surface points are dealt with in some detail, the emphasis being placed throughout on those structures that can be seen or felt from the surface of the body. Component parts of the digestive, respiratory, urinary and reproductive systems are shown in a number of the drawings, as are nerves and blood vessels. Special consideration is given to the structure of the head, with the emphasis on the nasal cavity, teeth, larynx and guttural pouches.The structure of the limbs is also illustrated in considerable detail, especially the foot, and reference is made to injuries and diseases that can result in poor conformation. The wealth of information contained in the book will be of great interest and value to veterinary and equine studies students, to owners, riders and breeders&#x2014;in fact anyone desiring to know more about the structure of the horse and what makes it one of the most beautiful of animals.</p><p>For many years Dr. Peter Goody lectured in anatomy at The Royal Veterinary College in London and he is the author of Dog Anatomy: A Pictorial Approach to Canine Structure also published by J.A.

The catch was that we could never break up, because I had run out of friends who were willing to help us move.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have good news,&#x201d; he said, striding into the library, where I was sprawled on the velvet chaise longue we&#x2019;d moved into the room only a few days ago. I was reading Persuasion again, but this time, I was reading Gabriel&#x2019;s very old, very delicate original edition. It was practically a religious experience.<br> <br>This was a vastly different library from just a year ago, when it was stuffed with my well-worn paperback versions of Jane Austen and Roald Dahl novels . . . and my creepily extensive collection of unicorn figurines. This was a grown-up library. I&#x2019;d cleared out quite a bit of space for Gabriel&#x2019;s books and furniture. It wasn&#x2019;t a difficult choice, considering that most of his books were valuable antiques, whereas most of mine were purchased at secondhand paperback shops.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d also packed most of my unicorn collection away in the cellar, threatening Gabriel with permanent sunburn if he so much as breathed a word about it to Dick.<br> <br>As Gabriel moved toward me, my pitifully hideous but lovable dog, Fitz, raised his head from my knee. Gently nudging Fitz aside, Gabriel pressed kisses along the line of my throat and announced, &#x201c;My VHS tapes now have a permanent home in your entertainment center, alphabetized and divided by genre.&#x201d;<br> <br>At this announcement, Fitz trotted out of the room in search of some pair of Gabriel&#x2019;s shoes that he hadn&#x2019;t managed to chew yet. I peered up at him over the top of the book, cringing. &#x201c;So now would be a really bad time to tell you that I don&#x2019;t have a VHS player anymore, right? This is a strictly digital household.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gabriel groaned and flopped down next to me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to buy Casablanca again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t notice the lack of a VCR in the TV cabinet?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;You know I don&#x2019;t understand half of the gadgets you have around here.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was true. The previous week, I&#x2019;d caught him trying to &#x201c;reboot&#x201d; my wireless network by kicking the router across the room. That was a long conversation. I shook my head. &#x201c;How did I end up in a relationship in which I am the tech person?&#x201d;<br> <br>He leaned in and kissed me. &#x201c;When you taught me how to work my voicemail, I knew I could never let you go.&#x201d;<br> <br>I giggled as Gabriel crossed the room and selected an older volume from the crowded shelves. I watched him move, unabashedly lovestruck. My human relationships had been few and far between, but they&#x2019;d been polite, civilized&#x2014;boring. I craved Gabriel with a bone-deep lust I&#x2019;d once reserved exclusively for Godiva truffles. I was fixated, not just in the physical sense&#x2014;although that was an obvious, and occasionally distracting, bonus&#x2014;but also with what he thought, how he saw the world, how he saw me. It was addictive to see myself reflected in his liquid silver eyes as strong, beautiful, intelligent, and interesting, though slightly exasperating. We each provided a vital service for the other. He made me stronger, and I kept him from taking himself too seriously.<br> <br>Gabriel settled in next to me, absorbed in a vintage copy of Jane Eyre. We sat like that for some time, quietly reveling in not having anything to do, anywhere to be. Crisis-free moments like this had been rare in our relationship.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jane Eyre?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Not your usual selection.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve only mentioned a dozen or so times that Edward Rochester is second only to Mr. Darcy on your &#x2018;Fictional Character Free Pass List.&#x2019; I want to know what I&#x2019;m up against.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smirked, snuggling into his side. &#x201c;You stand a fair chance. As long as you don&#x2019;t have a crazy wife hidden away somewhere . . .&#x201d; I stared at him for a beat.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head at me and opening his book.<br> <br>That may have seemed like an unfair shot, but Gabriel and I had suffered serious relationship issues related to his &#x201c;careful editing&#x201d; of his past. Case in point, the fire in my cellar caused by Gabriel&#x2019;s psycho childe, Jeanine, who had stalked me, nearly killed me with aerosol silver, and eventually arranged for our friend Andrea to be forcibly turned into a vampire. I try to resist pointing out that of all this could have been avoided if Gabriel had told me about Jeanine, instead of playing the tortured &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you because you&#x2019;ll hate me, so I&#x2019;ll protect you by keeping you in the dark&#x201d; card.<br> <br>Trust me, that card never works. I ended up with more undead friends and a serious cleaning bill for smoke damage. And then, as the vampire who technically defeated her in a Taser-versus-lunatic-soaked-in-lamp-oil battle, there was the hassle of receiving the proceeds from Jeanine&#x2019;s estate through the Council, then donating them to various charities. I didn&#x2019;t want one penny from her crazy behind darkening my doorway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just checking,&#x201d; I said, smiling sweetly and earning an undignified but amused snort from Gabriel. I returned my attention to poor, persevering Anne Elliot. Once again, I wondered how she managed to go so many chapters without bitch-slapping every single person she came into contact with. I actually wrote a paper about it in college. My professor deducted points for using the phrase bitch-slap in the title.<br> <br>It was totally worth it.<br> <br>I was just settling into the salons of Austenian Bath when Gabriel muttered, &#x201c;This is strange.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked up to see him pulling a long blue-gray thread from between the nearly translucent pages. My jaw dropped, and I was kneeling on the chaise in a flash. &#x201c;Is the binding coming loose? No, don&#x2019;t pull it! I can take it to my book doctor tomorrow night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop hyperventilating, sweetheart. I think it&#x2019;s a bookmark,&#x201d; he said, pulling on the thread until he&#x2019;d stretched it into my hand. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wound the thread around my finger. &#x201c;What passage was it marking?&#x201d;<br> <br>He scanned the page and lifted an eyebrow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Edward and Jane scene. I know how you love those. Edward&#x2019;s saying, &#x2018;I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you&#x2014;especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>I was so caught up in watching his lips as they formed the words that I barely noticed the sudden tension on the fiber wound around my finger. I realized now that Gabriel had slipped a ring onto the thread and was sliding it toward me. I watched as the respectable diamond twinkled in the light of the oil lamp.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Edward,&#x201d; Gabriel promised. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not afraid the thread will break and leave me bleeding. Our thread&#x2019;s already been tested. And it will hold up. I&#x2019;m asking you to make the link permanent. Please, marry me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled as the ring slid into my hand. I can&#x2019;t say this was a surprise. After the passing of the Federal Undead Marriage Act a few months before, Gabriel had officially proposed with this very tasteful solitaire. And I&#x2019;d said no. We&#x2019;d agreed to move in together because I&#x2019;d told Gabriel that I wasn&#x2019;t ready to be engaged yet. I was still adjusting to being a vampire. I was still recovering from Zeb and Jolene&#x2019;s wedding from hell. And oh, yeah, Gabriel&#x2019;s childe had just tried to murder me in my own home. I needed a breather.<br> <br>Gabriel had proposed again a few weeks later, and I wasn&#x2019;t ready. And then again on my birthday, and I still wasn&#x2019;t ready. Then he&#x2019;d promised not to ask me again until I was ready. And when he&#x2019;d said that, I&#x2019;d suddenly felt ready. And then I&#x2019;d felt like an idiot, because by then, he&#x2019;d stopped proposing.<br> <br>This was no ballpark Jumbotron, no ring hidden in a souffl�. It was the right way for Gabriel to ask me to marry him. And this was the right time.<br> <br>I nodded, mute, and the tension seemed to drain out of Gabriel. He grinned, slid his hands in my hair, and pulled me close. &#x201c;I struggled with the right passage, you know,&#x201d; he said, sliding the ring over my knuckle and kissing the web of skin between my fingers. &#x201c;I tried all of Austen&#x2019;s works, but the proposals are all so formal. I thought you would appreciate Edward&#x2019;s passion. And it still involves a Jane, after all. The ring is a copy of my mother&#x2019;s. I took the stone from her engagement ring and had a jeweler place it in a titanium setting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Titanium?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dick knew a guy,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course he did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a bit rough-and-tumble with jewelry, and I knew it would have to be able to stand up to . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nuclear winter?&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyebrow lifted. &#x201c;I never know with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed, throwing my arms around him and knocking him back on the seat and straddling his hips. Hovering over him, I nuzzled his neck, kissing and nipping before my fangs extended. I scraped them along his jugular, making him shudder and snake his hands around my waist, pulling me closer. I threaded my fingers through his coal-black hair and tugged his head back. His own fangs snicked out as he grinned up at me. He cupped my cheeks in his palms and gave me my first &#x201c;betrothed&#x201d; kiss.<br> <br>I have to say that if I&#x2019;d known that was what I had to look forward to as a married woman, I probably would have agreed to the engagement a lot sooner.<br> <br>He chuckled, pressing his thumb over my right canine, letting it pierce the skin. I nibbled at it as he twisted under me, a sweet little trickle of my sire&#x2019;s blood lending to an equally wet and pleasant sensation elsewhere. Pushing the scoop neck of my blouse away, he trailed his lips over the edge of my bra and snapped the left strap with his razor-sharp fangs.<br> <br>Your underwear budget triples when you&#x2019;re dating the undead.<br> <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t said yes, by the way,&#x201d; he murmured, snapping the other bra strap with his teeth.<br> <br>I gasped, and his thumb fell away from my mouth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry! Yes, yes, yes!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I find it disturbing that it took jewelry to make you cry &#x2018;yes, yes, yes&#x2019; in my presence for the first time?&#x201d; he asked, nuzzling my throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice.&#x201d; I snickered.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, who do you want to call first?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Your mother? Jenny? Zeb and Jolene? Oh, or I can call Dick, act like I&#x2019;m sobbing, and tell him you said no. Make him think that he has to take me out for an evening of drinking and not talking about our feelings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your idea of a joke?&#x201d; I asked, arching my eyebrow.<br> <br>He smirked, pulling my blouse over my head. My ruined bra fell to pieces and dropped to the floor. &#x201c;I find Dick&#x2019;s squirming in the face of emotional vulnerability to be the height of hilarity.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is why Dick wins all of your prank wars,&#x201d; I told him, as he pulled me back onto the chaise, my weight settled on his chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to call your mother first or Zeb?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head, cradling my face into his neck. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Neither. First, because I&#x2019;d like to wait until I can tell Aunt Jettie.&#x201d; I sighed, thinking fondly of my ghostly great-aunt and her equally deceased beau, Gilbert Wainwright. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t know when she&#x2019;ll be back from whatever astral jaunt she and Mr. Wainwright are taking. And second, because I want to lie here with you and enjoy being engaged without being squealed at or hug-strangled or told that I don&#x2019;t want to get married in the spring because it&#x2019;s impossible to get the right mix of seasonal tulips. I just want to . . .&#x201d; I sighed and rubbed my bare chest against his shirt in a distinctly non-virginal-bride manner. &#x201c;Bask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You never do what I expect you to,&#x201d; he said, kissing the ring on my finger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Admit it, that&#x2019;s part of the attraction.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Yes, it is.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;But you will be the one to tell your mother, right? I asked your father for his blessing. But I think you should be the one to deliver the news to your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snorted. Mama&#x2019;s reaction to our premarital cohabiting included screaming and yelling and threatening us with grounding. Considering that the worst that his own mother had ever done to him was call for her smelling salts, Gabriel was permanently scarred. He had flashbacks for weeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, I&#x2019;m thinking . . . Vegas Strip next Friday? We could gamble a little, get married, bail Dick out of jail, and be home by Monday,&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are not going to get married in some dingy chapel by an Elvis impersonator.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We could get a Streisand impersonator if it would make you more comfortable.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jane.&#x201d; He chuckled, exasperated. &#x201c;Is that really how you want to get married? Skulking off like we&#x2019;re ashamed of ourselves? Was that what little Jane dreamed and hoped for?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Little Jane thought she would marry Mark-Paul Gosselaar from Saved by the Bell in an English castle. Little Jane was an idiot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you want the English castle, you shall have it . . . minus this Mark-Paul person,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And if you really want the Vegas Strip, you shall have that. I want you to have the sort of wedding that will make you happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I countered, &#x201c;What about the kind of wedding that makes you happy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to show up in a tux and be told where to stand. That would make me very happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about wedding planning scares you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All of it. Picking out flowers. The dress. The bridesmaids&#x2019; dresses . . . no, wait, I&#x2019;m looking forward to that. Vengeance will be mine. But making all the choices . . . and then having those choices subtly criticized by every woman in my family. And the fact that each of those choices will probably &#x2018;ruin the wedding&#x2019; for someone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ruin the wedding?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When my sister wanted to get married at the country club, Grandma Ruthie said the wedding would be ruined for her if Jenny got married anywhere but the Baptist church. Several cousins threatened to boycott if Jenny didn&#x2019;t allow children to attend. Our great-uncle said he wouldn&#x2019;t come to the reception unless she served Pabst Blue Ribbon. People just seem to lose their minds when it comes to weddings. You can&#x2019;t make everybody happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we won&#x2019;t try,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do what makes us happy. It&#x2019;s our wedding, after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>I chuckled, pressing my lips to his throat, the curve of his jaw, as I rolled over him and slipped my fingers around his belt buckle, sliding it open. &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so naive. It&#x2019;s cute, really.&#x201d;<br> <br>We stayed in that happy (naked) secret-engagement bubble until I had to open the shop the next evening. Things had been progressing very nicely at Specialty Books since I&#x2019;d reopened earlier that year. While we initially depended on special efforts such as the &#x201c;Bump in the Night&#x201d; Book Club and meetings of the local chapter of the Friends and Family of the Undead to keep in the black, online sales and increasingly healthy in-store traffic made opening the electric bills and supplier invoices a lot less painful every month.<br> <br>There were times when I felt like a failure for never leaving the Hollow.

It was perhaps Commander Moss' finest hour.<br><br>The blond commander was so exultant this afternoon he didn't mind that Deputy Chief Adrian Lynch was keeping him waiting the allotted time. Chief Lynch kept all callers waiting precisely three minutes before coming to the phone, unless his secretary told him it was an assistant chief or the chief of police himself or one of the commissioners or a city councilman or anyone at City Hall who reported directly to the mayor.<br><br>Moss despised Lynch for having a do-nothing job and a specially ordered oversized desk. Moss knew for a fact that Deputy Chief Lynch had secret plans to increase his personal staff by two: one policewoman and one civilian, both of whom were busty young women. Commander Moss knew this because his adjutant, Lieutenant Dewey Treadwell, had sneaked into Lynch's office and searched his file basket when a janitor left the door open. Of course Lieutenant Treadwell could not receive a specifically worded commendation for his assignment but he did receive an ambiguously worded "attaboy" from Moss.<br><br>But there was another assignment which Treadwell had failed to carry out, and Commander Moss' stomach soured as he remembered it. It had to do with Moss' IQ score of 107. Throughout his twenty-one year career his IQ had meant nothing to his rise to the rank of commander. Indeed, he had not even known what his score was. He had been a state college honors student in police science and reasoned that no one with an ordinary IQ could manage this. But with the retirement of a senior deputy chief it had been called to Moss' attention by none other than Deputy Chief Lynch who didn't think the promotion board would consider a man for such a high police post who possessed an IQ of only 107. Lynch's own IQ was 140.<br><br>Commander Moss was livid. He took Lieutenant Treadwell to a Chinatown bar one Friday after work and forced the teetotaler to down five cocktails, promising his personal patronage for the rest of Treadwell's career if he could carry off a most delicate assignment. The ever ambitious, thirty year old lieutenant agreed to slip into Personnel Division that night and change Commander Moss' IQ score from 107 to 141.<br><br>Commander Moss downed his fourth Singapore sling and said, "Treadwell, I know I can depend on you."<br><br>But instantly the lieutenant's ambition gave way to fear. He stammered, "If anything ever . . . well, look, sir, the watch commander of Personnel is a former detective. He might start sniffing around. They have ways in the crime lab to tell if documents have been tampered with!"<br><br>"Don't talk crime lab to me, Treadwell," Moss replied. "Have you ever worked the Detective Bureau?"<br><br>"No, sir."<br><br>"You listen to me, Treadwell. You're an office pogue. You never been anything but an office pogue. You don't have the slightest idea what goes on in a working police division. But you keep your mouth shut and do what you're told and I'll see to it that you're a captain someday and you can have your own station to play with. You don't and I'll have you in uniform on the nightwatch in Watts. Understand me, Treadwell?"<br><br>"Oh, yes, sir!"<br><br>"Now drink your Pink Lady," Commander Moss commanded. (It was Hector Moss who had persuaded the chief of police that the traditional police rank of "inspector" was no longer viable in an era of violence when policemen are called upon to employ counterinsurgency tactics. Thanks to Moss all officers formerly of the inspector rank could now call themselves "commander." Moss had "Commander and Mrs. Hector Moss" painted on his home mailbox. Commander Moss had been a PFC in the army.)<br><br>Lieutenant Treadwell tried desperately every night for three weeks to sneak into Personnel Division. Each morning he reported a "Sorry, sir, negative" to Commander Moss. Lieutenant Dewey Treadwell lost ten pounds in those three weeks. He slept no more than four hours a night and then only fitfully. He was impotent. On the twenty-first night of his mission he was almost caught by a janitor. Lieutenant Treadwell was defeated and admitted it to Commander Moss on a black Wednesday morning.<br><br>The commander listened to his adjutant's excuses for a moment and said, "Did you get a good look at the janitor's face, Lieutenant?"<br><br>"Yes, sir. No . . . I don't know, sir. Why?"<br><br>"Because that boogie might live in Watts. And you'll need some friends there. because that's where i'm sending you on the next transfer, you incompetent fucking pansy!"<br><br>Commander Moss did not send Lieutenant Treadwell to Watts. He decided a spineless jellyfish was preferable to a smart aleck like Lieutenant Wirtz who worked for Deputy Chief Lynch. What he did was to go into Personnel Division in broad daylight, rip the commendation he wrote for Treadwell out of the file, draw a black X through it with a felt tipped pen, seal it in an envelope and leave it in Lieutenant Treadwell's incoming basket without comment.<br><br>Lieutenant Treadwell, after his hair started falling out in tufts, earned his way back into Commander Moss' good graces by authoring that portion of the Los Angeles Police Department manual which reads:<br><br>sideburns: Sideburns shall not extend below the bottom of the outer ear opening (the top of the earlobe) and shall end in a clean-shaven horizontal line. The flare (terminal portion of the sideburn) shall not exceed the width of the main portion of the sideburn by more than one-fourth of the unflared width.<br><br>moustaches: A short and neatly trimmed moustache of natural color may be worn. Moustaches shall not extend below the vermilion border of the upper lip or the corners of the mouth and may not extend to the side more than one-quarter inch beyond the corners of the mouth.<br><br>It took Lieutenant Treadwell thirteen weeks to compose the regulations. He was toasted and congratulated at a staff meeting. He beamed proudly. The regulations were perfect. No one could understand them.<br><br>As Commander Moss cooled his heels on the telephone waiting for Deputy Chief Adrian Lynch, the deputy chief was watching the second hand on his watch sweep past the normal three minute interval he reserved for most callers. Chief Lynch couldn't decide whether to give Moss a four minute wait or have his secretary say he would call back. Of course he couldn't be obviously rude. That bastard Moss had the ear of the chief of police and every other idiot who didn't know him well. Lynch hated those phony golden locks which Moss probably tinted. The asshole was at least forty-five years old and still looked like a Boy Scout. Not a wrinkle on that smirking kisser.<br><br>Lynch punched the phone button viciously and chirped, "Good morning, Deputy Chief Lynch speaking. <br><br>May I help you?"<br><br>"It's I, Chief. Hec Moss," said the commander, and Chief Lynch grimaced and thought, It's I. Oh shit!<br><br>"Yeah Hec."<br><br>"Chief, it's about the MacArthur Park orgy."<br><br>"Goddamnit, don't call it that!"<br><br>"Sorry sir. I meant the choir practice."<br><br>"Don't call it that either. That's all we need for the papers to pick it up."<br><br>"Yes sir," Moss said. And then more slyly, "I'm very cognizant of bad press, sir. After all, I squelched the thing and assuaged the victim's family."<br><br>Oh shit! thought Lynch. Assuaged. "Yes, Hec," said the chief wearily."Well sir, I was wondering, just to lock the thing up so to speak, I was wondering if we shouldn't have the chief order quick trial boards for every officer who was at the orgy. Fire them all."<br><br>"Don't . . . say . . . orgy. And don't . . . say . . . choir practice!"<br><br>"Sorry sir."<br><br>"That's not very good thinking, Hec." The chief tilted back in his chair, lifted his wing tips to the desk top, raised up his rust colored hairpiece and scratched his freckled rubbery scalp. "I don't think we should consider firing them."<br><br>"They deserve it, sir."<br><br>"They deserve more than that, Hec. The bastards deserve to be in jail as accessories to a killing. I'd personally like to see every one of them in Folsom Prison. But they might make a fuss. They might bring in some lawyers to the trial board. They might notify the press if we have a mass dismissal. In short, they might hurl a pail of defecation into the air conditioning."<br><br>Chief Lynch waited for a chuckle from Moss, got none and thought again about Moss' low IQ. "Anyway, Hec," he continued, "we have a real good case only against the one who did the shooting and I think we're stuck with that. We'll give the others a trial board and a six month suspension, but we'll take care of it quietly. Maybe we can scare some of them into resigning."<br><br>"Some goddamn shrink at General Hospital's saying that killer's nuts."<br><br>"What do you expect from General Hospital? What're they good for anyway but treating the lame and lazy on the welfare rolls? What do you plan to do about that dumbass detective who examined the officer the night of the shooting and ordered him taken to the psychiatric ward?"<br><br>"Ten days off?"<br><br>"Should get twenty."<br><br>"Afraid he might complain to the press."<br><br>"Guess you're right," Chief Lynch conceded grudgingly."Well, hope you're happy with our office, Chief!"<br><br>"You did a fine job, Hec," Deputy Chief Lynch said. "But I wish you'd talk to your secretary. I've had reports she didn't say 'good morning' twice last week when my adjutant called."<br><br>"Won't happen again, Chief."<br><br>&amp;q...</p><h2>Jacob&#39;s Ladder:</h2><p>A richly textured, carefully researched novel of the Civil War focuses on the life of a young heir to a Virginia plantation, Duncan Gatewood, who conceives a child with a mulatto slave and fights in Robert E.

He lives in Newcastle, Australia.</p>Chapter One&nbsp;<br>A child's cry jolted Brock from sleep. He blinked awake, wondering if it had been a dream. He held his breath, listening, then heard the almost human bark of the fox that lived in the railway cutting beyond the lane. That's all, he realised, only that. He heard the answering mournful horn of an approaching train. There must be fog on the line, autumn arriving in earnest at last.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now he was aware of other sounds, the clicking of the central heating pipes as they warmed, so it must be after five, which was when the timer switched on. He turned his head to read the illuminated numbers of the bedside clock. Five-fifteen. He would have preferred to lie for a while in the dark, sensing the day approach, taking time to think about one or two things. But there was so much to do, too much. He put on the light, pulled on his dressing gown and slippers, and padded down to the kitchen to put the kettle on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Brock carried the mug of tea through to the living room and lit the gas fire. On the table in front of him were three documents, all urgent. He slipped on his reading glasses and heaved the first, a thick report, onto his lap. Its title was Stage 3 Restructuring of the Metropolitan Police Service: Discussion Paper, and the words Restricted Circulation were stamped across the top. The accompanying memo had urged its importance, while his secretary, Dot, had heard from friends working at 10 Broadway, headquarters of New Scotland Yard, that Commander Sharpe was apoplectic over it. Brock took a sip of tea and opened it reluctantly, scanning the index, then turning to the summary. Not much wiser, he skipped through 'Chapter 1: Cost and performance criteria for alternative models of decentralisation'.<br>&nbsp;<br>He sighed and his attention strayed to the second item on the table, a letter, neat blue words on cream paper. He set the senior management report aside, picked up the letter and began to read it once again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dear David,<br>&nbsp;<br>I have to put this in writing, because I haven't been able to find the words to say aloud . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>He reached the end and sat lost in thought, feeling the drag of sadness inside him, the weight of time and loss. As if to emphasise this, his eyes moved to a small framed picture on the wall in front of him, a shabby little thing, a gift from a murderer. He remembered his first glimpse of it, long ago, above the mantelpiece of a house in Stepney as he kneeled on the floor with the body of Emily Crab, trying in vain to stop the flow of blood from her throat. Emily had ruined his suit but established his reputation on his first big murder case. Later, interviewing her husband, he had asked about the little picture, saying that it had looked to him like the work of the German artist Kurt Schwitters, whom he greatly admired. Walter Crab had been surprised and gratified by this recognition. He told Brock that during the war his mother had taken in a refugee, a man who had been hunted by the Gestapo from Germany to Norway, before escaping to London. The man was penniless, and Walter's mother had accepted the picture in lieu of a month's rent and board. When her friends saw it--an old bus ticket, a scrap of a newspaper headline and other fragments glued to a piece of cardboard--they laughed and told her she'd been had, and Walter had been mortified on his mother's account. Brock was the first person who had ever admired it, and yes, on the back was the signature K. Schwitters, and the title, Merz 598a, London, 1943. Then Walter confessed to Brock that he had murdered Emily and that the alibi provided by his sister was false. On the day that Crab was sentenced, Brock received a brown-paper parcel in the mail containing the Schwitters and a carefully written note from Walter, gifting him the picture in compensation for Brock's ruined suit. Ever since, Brock had regarded the little collage as an icon, a condensed statement of his own calling, gathering the discarded residue of people's lives and making out of it some kind of pattern and sense.<br>&nbsp;<br>Brock folded the letter and tucked it into the management report to mark the place he'd reached, then turned his attention to the third document on the table, every page of which he'd memorised over the weekend. It was a file marked Metropolitan Police, Case File Summary: Abductions of Aimee Jennifer Prentice and Lee Celine Hammond. He turned to the pictures of the missing girls, although they were already imprinted in his mind; Aimee with a cheeky lopsided grin and Lee, dreamy and pensive, as if she could sense the onset of puberty inside her slight body.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pinned to the cover of the report was the memo confirming the formation of a Major Enquiry Team, headed by Detective Chief Inspector David Brock, which would take control of the case as from 0800 hours on Monday October 13. Brock checked his watch. Two hours. Time to go.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2004 by Barry Maitland.

Braque thought the ideal state would be reached when we said nothing at all in front of a painting. But we are very far from reaching that state. We remain incorrigibly verbal creatures who love to explain things, to form opinions, to argue... It is a rare picture which stuns, or argues, us into silence. And if one does, it is only a short time before we want to explain and understand the very silence into which we have been plunged.&#39; Julian Barnes began writing about art with a chapter on G�ricault&#39;s The Raft of the Medusa in his 1989 novel A History of the World in 10� Chapters . Since then he has written a series of remarkable essays, chiefly about French artists, which trace the story of how art made its way from Romanticism to Realism and into Modernism. Fully illustrated in colour throughout, Keeping an Eye Open contains Barnes&#39; essays on G�ricault, Delacroix, Courbet, Manet, Fantin-Latour, C�zanne, Degas, Redon, Bonnard, Vuillard, Vallotton, Braque, Magritte, Oldenburg, Howard Hodgkin and Lucian Freud.</p><p>Julian Barnes is the author of twelve novels, including The Sense of an Ending, which won the 2011 Man Booker Prize for Fiction. He has also written three books of short stories, four collections of essays and two books of non-fiction, Nothing to be Frightened Of and the Sunday Times number one bestseller Levels of Life. In 2017 he was awarded the Legion d&#39;honneur.G�ricault: Catastrophe into Art<br><br>I<br><br>It began with a portent.<br><br>They had doubled Cape Finisterre and were sailing south before a fresh wind when a school of porpoises surrounded the frigate. Those on board crowded the poop and the breastwork, marvelling at the animals&#x2019; ability to circle a vessel already gaily proceeding at nine or ten knots. But as they watched the sporting of the porpoises, a cry was raised. A cabin boy had fallen through one of the fore portholes on the larboard side. A signal gun was fired, a life-raft thrown out, and the vessel hove to. But these manoeuvres were cumbrously done, and by the time the six-oared barge was let down, it was in vain. They could not find the raft, let alone the boy. He was only fifteen years old, and those who knew him maintained that he was a strong swimmer; they conjectured that he would most probably have reached the raft. If so, he doubtless perished upon it, after having experienced the most cruel sufferings.<br><br>The expedition for Senegal consisted of four vessels: a frigate, a corvette, a flute and a brig. It had set sail from the Island of Aix on 17th June 1816 with 365 people on board. Now it continued south with its complement reduced by one. They provisioned at Tenerife, taking on precious wines, oranges, lemons, banian figs and vegetables of all kinds. Here they noted the depravity of the local inhabitants: the women of Saint Croix stood at their doors and urged the Frenchmen to enter, confident that their husbands&#x2019; jealousies would be cured by the monks of the Inquisition who would speak disapprovingly of conjugal mania as the blinding gift of Satan. Reflective passengers ascribed such behaviour to the southern sun, whose power, it is known, weakens both natural and moral bonds.<br><br>From Tenerife they sailed south-south-west. Fresh winds and navigational ineptitude scattered the flotilla. Alone, the frigate passed the tropic and rounded Cape Barbas. It was running close to the shore, at times no more than half a cannon shot away. The sea was strewn with rocks; brigantines could not frequent these seas at low water. They had doubled Cape Blanco, or so they believed, when they found themselves in shallows; the lead was cast every half-hour. At daybreak Mr. Maudet, ensign of the watch, made out the reckoning upon a chicken coop, and judged that they were on the edge of the Arguin reef. His advice was discounted. But even those unschooled in the sea could observe that the water had changed colour; weed was apparent at the ship&#x2019;s side, and a great many fish were being taken. In calm seas and clear weather, they were running aground. The lead announced eighteen fathoms, then shortly afterwards six fathoms. The frigate, luffing, almost immediately gave a heel; a second and third, then stopped. The sounding line showed a depth of five metres and sixty centimetres.<br><br>By misfortune, they had struck the reef at high tide; and the seas growing violent, attempts to free the ship failed. The frigate was assuredly lost. Since the boats it carried were not capacious enough to contain the whole personnel, it was decided to build a raft and embark upon it those who could not be put into the boats. The raft would then be towed to the shore and all would be saved. This plan was perfectly well laid; but as two of the company were later to affirm, it was traced upon loose sand, which was dispersed by the breath of egotism.<br><br>The raft was made, and well made, places in the boats allotted, provisions made ready. At daybreak, with two metres and seventy centimetres of water in the hold and the pumps failing, the order was given to abandon ship. Yet disorder quickly embraced the well-laid plan. The allotment of places was ignored, and the provisions were carelessly handled, forgotten or lost in the waters. One hundred and fifty was to be the complement of the raft: 120 soldiers, including officers, twenty-nine sailors and male passengers, one woman. But scarcely had fifty men got on board this machine&#x2014;whose extent was twenty metres in length and seven in breadth&#x2014;than it sank under the water to a depth of at least seventy centimetres. They cast off the barrels of flour which had been embarked, whereupon the level of the raft rose; the remaining people descended upon it, and it sank again. When the machine was fully laden, it was a metre beneath the surface, and those on board so crowded they could not take a single step; at the back and front, they were in water up to the waist. Loose flour barrels were cast against them by the waves; a twenty-five-pound bag of biscuit was thrown down to them, which the water converted at once into a paste.<br><br>It had been intended that one of the naval officers should take command of the raft; but this officer declined to come on board. At seven o&#x2019;clock in the morning the signal for departure was given, and the little flotilla pulled away from the abandoned frigate. Seventeen persons had refused to leave the vessel, or had concealed themselves away, and thus remained on board to discover their fate.<br><br>The raft was towed by four boats in line astern, preceded by a pinnace, which made soundings. As the boats took up their positions, cries of Vive le roi! arose from the men on the raft, and a small white flag was raised upon the end of a musket. But it was at this instant of greatest hope and expectation for those upon the raft that the breath of egotism was added to the normal winds of the sea. One by one, whether for reason of self-interest, incompetence, misfortune or seeming necessity, the tow-ropes were cast aside.<br><br>The raft was barely two leagues from the frigate when it was abandoned. Those on board had wine, a little brandy, some water and a small portion of sodden biscuit. They had been given no compass or chart. With neither oars nor rudder, there was no means of controlling the raft, and little means either of controlling those upon it, who were constantly flung against one another as the waters rolled over them. In the first night, a storm got up and threw the machine with great violence; the cries of those on board mingled with the roaring of the billows. Some attached ropes to the timbers of the craft, and held fast to these; all were buffeted without mercy. By daybreak the air was filled with lamentable cries; vows which could never be fulfilled were offered up to Heaven, and all prepared themselves for imminent death. It was impossible to form an idea of that first night which was not below the truth.<br><br>The next day the seas were calm, and for many hope was rekindled. Nevertheless, two young lads and a baker, convinced that there was no escape from death, bade farewell to their companions and willingly embraced the sea. It was during this day that those on the raft began to experience their first delusions. Some fancied that they saw land, others espied vessels come to save them, and the dashing of these deceptive hopes upon the rocks provoked greater despondency.<br><br>The second night was more terrible than the first. The seas were mountainous and the raft constantly near to being overthrown; the officers, clustered by the short mast, ordered the soldiery from one side of the machine to the other to counterbalance the energy of the waves. A group of men, certain that they were lost, broke open a cask of wine and resolved to soothe their last moments by abandoning the power of reason; in which they succeeded, until the sea water coming in through the hole they had made in the cask spoiled the wine. Thus doubly maddened, these disordered men determined to send all to a common destruction, and to this end attacked the ropes that bound the raft together. The mutineers being resisted, a pitched battle took place amid the waves and the darkness of the night. Order was restored, and there was an hour of tranquillity upon that fatal machine. But at midnight the soldiery rose again and attacked their superiors with knives and sabres; those without weapons were so deranged that they attempted to tear at the officers with their teeth, and many bites were endured. Men were thrown into the sea, bludgeoned, stabbed; two barrels of wine were thrown overboard and the last of the water. By the time the villains were subdued, the raft was laden with corpses.<br><br>During the first uprising, a workman by the name of Dominique, who had joined the mutineers, was cast into the sea. On hearing the piteous cries of this treacherous underling, the engineer in charge of the workmen threw himself into the water and, taking the villain by the hair, succeeded in dragging him back on board. Dominique&#x2019;s head had been split open by a sabre. In the darkness the wound was bound up and the wretch restored to life. But no sooner was he so revived than ingratitude overtook him; he joined the mutineers and rose with them again. This time he found less fortune and less mercy; he perished that night.<br><br>Delirium now menaced the unhappy survivors. Some threw themselves into the sea; some fell into torpor; some unfortunate wretches rushed at their comrades with sabres drawn, demanding to be given the wing of a chicken. The engineer whose bravery had saved the workman Dominique pictured himself travelling the fine plains of Italy, and one of the officers saying to him, &#x201c;I remember that we have been deserted by the boats; but fear nothing; I have just written to the governor, and in a few hours we will be saved.&#x201d; The engineer, calm in his delirium, responded thus: &#x201c;Have you a pigeon to carry your orders with as much celerity?&#x201d;<br><br>Only one cask of wine remained for the sixty still on board the raft. They collected tags from the soldiers and fashioned them into fish-hooks; they took a bayonet and bent it into such shape as to catch a shark. Whereupon a shark arrived, and seized the bayonet, and with a savage twist of its jaw straightened it fully out again, and swam away.<br><br>An extreme resource proved necessary to prolong their miserable existence. Some of those who had survived the night of the mutiny fell upon the corpses and hacked pieces from them, devouring the flesh upon the instant. Most of the officers refused this meat; though one proposed that it should first be dried to make it more palatable. Some tried chewing sword-belts and cartouche boxes, and the leather trimmings to their hats, with little benefit. One sailor attempted to eat his own excrement, but he could not succeed.<br><br>The third day was calm and fine. They took repose, but cruel dreams added to the horrors already inflicted by hunger and thirst. The raft, which now carried less than one half its original complement, had risen up in the water, an unforeseen benefit of the night&#x2019;s mutinies. Yet those on board remained in water to the knees, and could only repose standing up, pressed against one another in a solid mass. On the fourth morning they perceived that a dozen of their fellows had died in the night; the bodies were given to the sea, except for one that was reserved against their hunger. At four o&#x2019;clock that afternoon a shoal of flying fish passed over the raft, and many became ensnared in the extremities of the machine. That night they dressed the fish, but their hunger was so great and each portion so exiguous that many of them added human flesh to the fish, and the flesh being dressed was found less repugnant. Even the officers began to eat it when presented in this form.<br><br>It was from this day onwards that all learned to consume human flesh. The next night was to bring a fresh supply. Some Spaniards, Italians and Negroes, who had remained neutral during the first mutinies, conspired together with the plan of throwing their superiors overboard and escaping to the shore, which they believed to be at hand, with those valuables and possessions that had been placed into a bag and hung upon the mast. Once more, a terrible combat ensued, and blood washed over the fatal raft. When this third mutiny was finally suppressed, there remained no more than thirty on board, and the raft had risen yet again in the water. Barely a man lay without wounds, into which salt water constantly flowed, and piercing cries were heard.<br><br>On the seventh day two soldiers concealed themselves behind the last barrel of wine. They struck a hole in it and began to drink the wine through a straw. On being discovered, the two trespassers were instantly cast into the water, in accordance with the necessary law that had been promulgated.<br><br>It was now that the most terrible decision came to be taken. On counting their numbers, it was found that they were twenty-seven. Fifteen of these were likely to live for some days; the rest, suffering from large wounds and many of them delirious, had but the smallest chance of survival. In the time that might elapse before their deaths, however, they would surely diminish further the limited supply of provisions. It was calculated that they could well drink between them as many as thirty or forty bottles of wine. To put the sick on half-allowance was to kill them by degrees. And thus, after a debate in which the most dreadful despair presided, it was agreed among the fifteen healthy persons that their sick comrades must, for the common good of those who might yet survive, be cast into the sea. Three sailors and a soldier, their hearts now hardened by the constant sight of death, performed these repugnant but necessary executions. The healthy were separated from the unhealthy like the clean from the unclean.<br><br>After this cruel sacrifice, the last fifteen survivors threw all their arms into the water, reserving only a sabre lest some rope or wood might need cutting. There was sustenance left for six days while they awaited death.<br><br>Then came a small event which each interpreted according to his nature. A white butterfly, of a species common in France, appeared over their heads fluttering, and settled upon the sail. To some, crazed with hunger, it seemed that even this could make a morsel. To others, the ease with which their visitor moved appeared a very mockery of those who lay exhausted and almost motionless beneath it. To yet others, this simple butterfly was a sign, a messenger from Heaven as white as Noah&#x2019;s dove. Even those sceptical ones who declined to recognise a divine instrument knew that butterflies travel little distance from the dry land, and were raised by cautious hope.</p><h2>Documentos Litorgicos (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Contains the complete text in Spanish of many documents including 'La Inculturacion de la Liturgia en un Ambiente Hispano'.

From the righteous fury of the Viking queen Sigrid the Strong-Minded, who burned unwanted suitors alive; to the brilliant but too-cunning Moor, al-Mansur the Illustrious Victor; to the aptly named English king Ethelred the Unready; to the abiding genius of the age, Pope Sylvester II&#x2014;warrior kings and concubine empresses, maniacal warriors and religious zealots bring this stirring period to life.</p><p>With the turn of the century approaching, talk of the apocalypse runs rampant. In <i>The Last Apocalypse</i>, James Reston reminds us that such talk is nothing new. At the previous turn of the millennium, Vikings, Moors, and Hungarian Magyars beseiged Europe with wanton cruelty and violence, spreading fear and destruction wherever they went and leading many to believe that the end of the world was near. Such colorful characters as Sigrid the Haughty, Svein Forkbeard, Ethelred the Unready, and Al-Mansor the Illustrious Victor were the heroes and villains of the era.<p> Reston, author of previous works that include <i>Galileo: A Life</i> and <i>Sherman's March</i>, evokes the historical essence of the time using limited legal and church documents, archaeological artifacts, and rare contemporary literary accounts. Reston's history reads like an engrossing novel, carefully crafted without getting bogged down in dry details. He skillfully interweaves the complex story of how each European country dealt with these changes, bringing the period back to life.</p><p> Reston portrays A.D. 999 as a profound turning point for mankind, mapping out the fate of each country as the Christian kingdoms, unified in belief, brutally conquered and imposed the will of Christianity upon heathen Europe. In the space of 60 years, the established ruling elite were slaughtered or forced to succumb to the turning religious tide. By A.D. 1050, the sign of the cross fell like an ominous shadow across Europe, paradoxically signifying the dawn of peace under Christian unity.</p>Praise for James Reston, Jr.'s <i>Galileo: A Life</i><p>"It is to James Reston's credit that his masterful new biography of Galileo Galilei manages to capture the cultural maelstrom of the Renaissance as colorfully as it does, without making his subject seem too much like some time-traveling hero from a more sensible age. In fact, it is the triumph of the book that Reston himself is able to offer a convincing imitation of a Renaissance man...a brilliant biography."<br>--Bruno Maddox, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>A spirited evocation of Galileo's charisma and capacity...fresh, sinewy and altogether admirable."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A spellbinding story and a vivid, provocative portrait of a Galileo we have not seen before. James Reston, Jr., throws important new light on Galileo's vital place in the history of world politics, science and religion. For younger readers, his book is a splendid introduction; those who thought they understood Galileo will be startled to find out how little they knew."<br>--Michael R.

Spanning time and place, the writers showcased in Endless Feasts share their memories of exquisite meals and experiences in far-flung locales. Featured are essays such as M.F.K. Fisher&#x2019;s marvelous &#x201c;Three Swiss Inns,&#x201d; about three exceptional restaurants she encountered while traveling through Switzerland. In the most out-of-the-way gasthaus, she finds trout swimming in a seemingly decorative tank, but in the flash of an eye the fish are scooped up in a net and carted off to the kitchen, to appear minutes later cooked to such delicate lightness and tender perfection that one could never hope to duplicate it. Ruth Harkness&#x2019;s &#x201c;In a Tibetan Lamasery&#x201d; is the story of her travels as a single woman exploring Tibet during the Second World War. She describes her crumbling accommodations, the unusual animals caught by hunters, and the estimated ten thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of rare pheasants she ate during one winter.<br><br>Complete with a new Introduction by Reichl and a sampling of original recipes, this savory collection contains essays by Anita Loos, James Beard, Madhur Jaffrey, Robert P.

The assembled cast is tops: James Beard on pasta; Elizabeth David lauding epicure Edouard de Pomaine; M.F.K. Fisher on her favorite Swiss inns; Paul Theroux writing about crossing the Rockies; Anita Loos evoking cocktail parties of the 1920s. Compiled by <i>Gourmet</i> editor-in-chief (and series editor) Ruth Reichl, and with recipes from the contributors' pieces--including hobotee, North Carolina's famed meat custard, and Katherine Hepburn's brownies--the book will delight armchair and meal-chasing foodies alike.<p> Most readers will discover new voices among the more familiar. Present, as noted, is M.F.K. Fisher, offering one of her most splendid sun-and-shadow portraits, but there's also the underread (and magnificently dry) Ruth Harkness providing glimpses of a World War II winter spent in a crumbling Tibetan Lamasery, where she devoured $10,000 worth of rare pheasants; the drolly avuncular Joseph Wechsburg on Austria's legendary patisserie, Demel's ("the loudest sound you hear there is the breaking of crisp strudel dough"); crusty Maine poet Robert P. Coffin on Down East breakfasts and lobstering ("a night like a night of marriage"); and the reportorial, unblinking Jay Jacobs on Beard himself ("the man remembers in minute detail every one of the eighty-seven-thousand-odd meals he has eaten since his birth"). The quality of the essays varies, of course, but the book overwhelmingly gladdens in its rich breadth of time and place and evocative storytelling. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>&#x201c;Endless Feasts is just a little snack, a sample tidbit of the many riches still hidden in the archives of [Gourmet] magazine.

The battered wagon train finally reaches Oregon after traveling over two thousand miles.</p><p>Patricia Hermes was born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York. An avid reader, she had time to practice both reading and writing when she came down with rheumatic fever, which left her stuck in bed for months. Hermes majored in speech and English at St. John's University, and taught junior high school English and social studies before taking time off to raise her five children. Returning to teaching after a number of years, she found it less satisfying than she'd remembered, and decided to try her hand at writing for publication. She took a class in writing nonfiction for adults; the teacher, Russell Freedman, would go on to win the Newbery Medal.<br><br>After publishing some articles, Hermes found the niche she'd been looking for: her first novel for young readers, What If They Knew?, was published in 1980. Hermes gave the main character in the book epilepsy, a problem she had dealt with herself as a child. Readers responded well to the believable situation, and over the years Hermes has continued to write stories featuring youngsters in difficult situations, so that readers can turn to her books knowing they are not alone. She has written more than 20 books for children and young adults.<br><br>Patricia Hermes lives in Connecticut, where she spends four hours of the day writing and the rest editing her work and answering letters.

Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia."We could lose the case," San Antonio Detective Sergeant Rick Marquez muttered as he glared at one of the newest detectives on his squad.<p>"I'm really sorry," Gwendolyn Cassaway said, wincing. "I tripped. It was an accident."</p><p>He stared at her through narrowed dark eyes, his sensual lips compressed. "You tripped because you're nearsighted and you won't wear glasses." Personally, he didn't think the lack of them did anything for her, if vanity was the issue. She had a pleasant face, and an exquisite complexion, but she was no raving beauty. Her finest feature was her wealth of thick platinum-blond hair that she wore in a high bun on top of her head. She never wore it down.</p><p>"Glasses get in my way and I can't ever get them clean enough," she muttered. "That coating just causes smears unless you use the proper cleaning materials. And I can't ever find them," she said defensively.</p><p>He drew in a long, exasperated breath and perched on the edge of the desk in his office. In the posture, his .45 Colt ACP in its distinctive leather holster was displayed next to his badge on his belt. So were his powerful legs, and to their best advantage. He was tall and muscular, without it being obvious. He had a light olive complexion and thick long black hair that he wore in a ponytail. He was very attractive, but he couldn't ever seem to wind up with a serious girlfriend. Women found him useful as a sympathetic shoulder to cry on over their true loves. One woman refused to date him when she realized that he wore his pistol even off duty. He'd tried to explain that it was a necessary thing, but it hadn't given him any points with her. He went to the opera, which he loved, all alone. He went everywhere alone. He was almost thirty-one, and lonelier than ever. It made him irritable.</p><p>And here was Gwen making it all worse, messing up his crime scene, threatening the delicate chain of evidence that could lead to a conviction in a complex murder.</p><p>A college freshman, pretty and blonde, had been brutally assaulted and killed. They had no suspects and trace evidence was very sketchy already. Gwen had almost contaminated the scene by stepping too close to a blood smear.</p><p>He was not in a good mood. He was hungry. He was going to be late for lunch, because he had to chew her out. If he didn't, the lieutenant surely would, and Cal Hollister was even meaner than Marquez.</p><p>"You could also lose your job," Marquez pointed out. "You're new in the department."</p><p>She grimaced. "I know." She shrugged. "I guess I could go back to the Atlanta P.D. if I had to," she said with grim resignation. She looked at him with pale green eyes that were almost translucent. He'd never seen eyes that color.</p><p>"You just have to be more careful, Cassaway," he cautioned.</p><p>"Yes, sir. I'll do my best."</p><p>He tried not to look at the T-shirt she was wearing under a lightweight denim jacket with her jeans. It was unseasonably warm for November but a jacket felt good against the morning chill.</p><p>On her T-shirt was a picture of a little green alien, the sort sold in novelty shops, with a legend that read, Have You Seen My Spaceship? He averted his eyes and tried not to grin.</p><p>She tugged her jacket closer. "Sorry. But they don't have any regulations against T-shirts here, do they?"</p><p>"If the lieutenant sees that one, you'll find out," he said.</p><p>She sighed. "I'll try to conform. It's just that I come from a very weird family. My mother worked for the FBI. My father was, uh, in the military. My brother is..." She hesitated and swallowed. "My brother <i>was</i> in military intelligence." He frowned. "Deceased?"</p><p>She nodded. She still couldn't talk about it. The pain was too fresh.</p><p>"Sorry," he said stiffly.</p><p>She shifted. "Larry died very bravely during a covert ops mission in the Middle East. But he was my only sibling. It's hard to talk about."</p><p>"I can understand that." He stood up, glancing at the military watch he wore on his left wrist. "Time for lunch."</p><p>"Oh, I have other plans.. " she began quickly.</p><p>He glared at her. "It was a remark, not an invitation. I don't date colleagues," he said very curtly.</p><p>She blushed all the way down to her throat. She swallowed and stood taller. "Sorry. I was...I meant...that is."</p><p>He waved the excuses away. "We'll talk about this some more later. Meanwhile, please do something about your vision. You can't investigate a crime scene you can't see!"</p><p>She nodded. "Yes, sir. Absolutely."</p><p>He opened the door and let her go out first, noticing absently that her head only came up to his shoulder and that she smelled like spring roses, the pink ones that grew in his mother's garden down in Jacobsville. It was an elusive, very faint fragrance. He approved. Some women who worked in the office seemed to bathe in perfume and always had headaches and allergies and never seemed to think about the connection. Once, a fellow detective had had an almost-fatal asthma attack after a clerical worker stood near him wearing what smelled like an entire bottle of perfume.</p><p>Gwendolyn stopped suddenly and he plowed into her, his hands sweeping out to grasp her shoulders and steady her before she fell from his momentum.</p><p>"Oh, sorry!" she exclaimed, and felt a thrill of pleasure at the warm strength of the big hands holding her so gently.</p><p>He removed them at once. "What is it?"</p><p>She had to force her mind to work. Detective Sergeant Marquez was very sexy and she'd been drawn to him since her first sight of him several weeks before. "I meant to ask if you wanted me to check with Alice Fowler over at the crime lab about the digital camera we found in the murdered woman's apartment. By now, she might have something on the trace evidence."</p><p>"Good idea. You do that."</p><p>"I'll swing past there on my way back to the office after lunch," she promised, and beamed, because it was a big case and he was letting her contribute to solving it. "Thanks."</p><p>He nodded, his mind already on the wonderful beef Stroganoff he was going to order at the nearby cafe where he usually had lunch. He'd been looking forward to it all week. It was Friday and he could splurge.</p><p>Tomorrow was his day off. He was going to spend it helping his mother, Barbara, process and can a bushel of hothouse tomatoes she'd been given by an organic gardener with a greenhouse. She owned Barbara's Cafe in Jacobsville, and she liked to use her organic vegetables and herbs in the meals she prepared for her clients. They would add to the store of canned summer tomatoes that she'd already processed earlier in the year.</p><p>He owed her a lot. He'd been orphaned in junior high school and Barbara Ferguson, who'd just lost her husband in an accident, and suffered a miscarriage, had taken him in. His mother had once worked for Barbara at the cafe just briefly. Then his parents&#x2014;well, his mother and stepfather&#x2014;had died in a wreck, leaving a single, lonely child all on his own. Rick had been a terrible teen, always in trouble, bad-tempered and moody. He'd been afraid when he lost his mother. He had no other living relatives of whom he was aware, and no place to go. Barbara had stepped in and given him a home. He loved her no less than he'd loved his real mother, and he was quite protective of her. He never spoke of his stepfather. He tried not to remember him at all.</p><p>Barbara wanted him to marry and settle down and have a family. She harped on it all the time. She even introduced him to single women. Nothing helped. He seemed to be an eternally on-sale item in the matrimonial market that everybody bypassed for the fancier merchandise. He laughed shortly to himself at the thought.</p><p>Gwen watched him leave and wondered why he'd laughed. She was embarrassed that she'd thought he was asking her to lunch. He didn't seem to have a girlfriend and everybody joked about his nonexistent love life. But he wasn't attracted to Gwen in that way. It didn't matter. No man had ever liked her, really. She was everybody's confidante, the good girl who could give advice about how to please other women with small gifts and entertainments. But she was never asked out for herself.</p><p>She knew she wasn't pretty. She was always passed over for the flashy women, the assertive women, the powerful women. The women who didn't think sex before marriage was a sin. She'd had a man double over laughing when she'd told him that, after he expected a night in bed in return for a nice meal and the theater. Then he'd become angry, having spent so much money on her with nothing to show for it. The experience had soured her.</p><p>"Don Quixote," she murmured to herself. "I'm Don Quixote."</p><p>"Wrong sex," Detective Sergeant Gail Rogers said as she paused beside the newcomer. Rogers was the mother of some very wealthy ranchers in Comanche Wells, but she kept her job and her own income. She was an amazing peace officer. Gwen admired her tremendously. "And what's that all about?" she asked.</p><p>Gwen sighed, glancing around to make sure they weren't being overheard. "I won't give out on dates," she whispered. "So men think I'm insane." She shrugged. "I'm Don Quixote, trying to restore morality and idealism to a decadent world."</p><p>Rogers didn't laugh. She smiled, very kindly. "He was noble, in his way. An idealist with a dream."</p><p>"He was nutty as a fruitcake." Gwen sighed.</p><p>"Yes, but he made everyone around him feel of worth, like the prostitute whom he idealized as a great lady for whom he quested," came the surprising reply. "He gave dreams to people who had given them up for harsh reality. He was adored by them."</p><p>Gwen laughed. "Yes, I suppose he wasn't so bad at that."</p><p>"People should have ideals, even if they ...</p></p><h2>Welcome to the N.H.K., Volume 5</h2><p>Follows the bizarre journey of Sato Tatsuhiro, a drug-addled shut-in who believes a sinister organization, the N.H.K., is the cause of all of his troubles and his relationship with Misaki, a girl he thinks is trying to kill him, but who becomes the love of his home-bound life.</p><p></p><h2>American Agent, The (Maisie Dobbs)</h2><p>When Catherine Saxon, an American correspondent reporting on the war in Europe, is found murdered in her London digs, news of her death is concealed by British authorities.

As you read these stories, you will be amazed, astounded, and oftentimes confounded by the power of ingenuity, serendipity, and the strange, comical coincidence of life and how it proves, once again, that truth is ultimately stranger than fiction.</p><p>From the amusing title story of the holdup that didn't happen, to the riveting account of scientists tracking Black Death through the arroyos, to the ironic account of how a black cowboy's commonsense intelligence destroyed the dogma of the Smithsonian Institution, master storyteller Tony Hillerman reveals the present and timeless past of one of America's most beautiful and haunting regions.</p></p><p><p>Tony Hillerman (1925&#x2013;2008), an Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident since 1963, was the author of 29 books, including the popular 18-book mystery series featuring Navajo police officers Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, two non-series novels, two children&#x2019;s books, and nonfiction works. He had received every major honor for mystery fiction; awards ranging from the Navajo Tribal Council's commendation to France 's esteemed <em>Grand prix de litterature policiere. </em>Western Writers of America honored him with the Wister Award for Lifetime achievement in 2008. He served as president of the prestigious Mystery Writers of America, and was honored with that group&#x2019;s Edgar Award and as one of mystery fiction&#x2019;s Grand Masters. In 2001, his memoir, <em>Seldom Disappointed, </em>won both the Anthony and Agatha Awards for best nonfiction.</p>Capturing the listener with his soft drawl, Tony Hillerman reads stories based on real-life events in Taos and other areas of New Mexico. He expertly adds personal flair and deep feelings to his stories, including a lot of humor and good-natured comments about the land and the people. During some of the stories Hillerman seems to be speaking directly to the listener. Hearing the author read allows the listener to learn a little about Hillerman the man, as well as the country he so obviously loves. His performance adds immensely to the value of these stories.

Selfies breed narcissism. On Twitter and comment boards, hostility reigns. Pundits and psychologists warn us that digital technologies substantially alter our emotional states. But in this lively and surprising account, we learn that technology doesn&#x2019;t just affect how we feel from moment to moment&#x2015;it changes profoundly the underlying emotions themselves.</p><p><i>Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid</i> examines nineteenth- and twentieth-century letters, diaries, and memoirs and draws on contemporary research and interviews with Americans of different ages and backgrounds to document how our emotions have been transformed by technological change. Where we now strive to escape boredom, earlier generations saw unstructured time as an opportunity for productivity and creativity. Where loneliness is now pathologized, we once thought of solitude as virtuous. Even as we ask whether technology is making us lonelier, it is altering the meaning of loneliness.</p><p>In this timely book, Luke Fernandez and Susan Matt contend that current technology has removed many of the limits on our emotional landscape. Thus we seek to be constantly stimulated, engaged, and validated, while our anger and antisocial impulses are not only unconstrained but affirmed by the digital company we keep.</p></p><p>Luke Fernandez is Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Co-Director of the Tech Outreach Center at Weber State University.

Examining various platforms and devices, from the 19th-century telegraph to modern innovations, including Facebook and smartphones, they tell a powerful story of how new forms of technology are continually integrated into the human experience. A particularly fascinating chapter outlines the history of anger in American society, from a trait to be publicly suppressed, especially in marginalized groups, to something which social media has transformed into "a right of all." Another revealing section compares modern concerns about the narcissism of selfies to 19th-century moralizing about photography--perhaps surprisingly, observers then thought photographs might dispel rather than promote vanity, by providing people with more honest portraits than had been customary in painting. Rather than condemn modern technology out of hand, Fernandez and Matt simply connect emotional constants of the human experience to new platforms that alter how they are expressed and perceived. Anyone interested in seeing the digital age through a new perspective should be pleased with this rich account.&nbsp;"&nbsp;--<i>Publisher's Weekly</i><br><br>"<i>Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid</i>&nbsp;is a crisp and compelling read.

The premise is remarkably simple: track the ways in which emotions have changed over time in relation to new waves of communication technology. Using reflective storytelling built on historical research and contemporary data, the authors show us just how singular our own moment in time is."--Rob Boddice, Free University, Berlin<br><br>"In this wonderful book we learn that new ideas are often just repeats from the past, and we may get more than we bargained for with our latest technological engagements.&nbsp;<i>Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid</i>&nbsp;is a must-read for anyone worried about how today's surfeit of digital devices may challenge our humanity, and wondering if, given the emotional costs, we might choose another way."--Safiya Umoja Noble, author of&nbsp;<i>Algorithms of Oppression</i><br><br>Online immersion can distort emotion. However, technologies have been shaping US emotional culture for more than a century, argue computer scientist Luke Fernandez and historian Susan Matt in this original study. Marshalling archival sources and interviews, they trace how norms (say, around loneliness) have shifted with technological change. Broadcasting deregulation under President Ronald Reagan, for instance, made room for anger-inducing right-wing 'talk radio'. Yet, as they show, the digital world lifts even more limits, stimulating and affirming a range of negative emotions.--<i>Nature</i></p><h2>Modern Classics Concept of Mind (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>This epoch-making book cuts through confused thinking and forces us to re-examine many cherished ideas about knowledge, imagination, consciousness and the intellect.

So more than a decade later, when she met boisterous, charismatic Charlie Blackwell, she hardly gave him a second look: She was serious and thoughtful, and he would rather crack a joke than offer a real insight; he was the wealthy son of a bastion family of the Republican party, and she was a school librarian and registered Democrat.

As Charlie&#x2019;s tumultuous and controversial second term in the White House wears on, Alice must face contradictions years in the making: How can she both love and fundamentally disagree with her husband?

I&#x2019;d accompanied my grandmother to the grocery store&#x2014;that morning, while reading a novel that mentioned hearts of palm, she&#x2019;d been seized by a desire to have some herself and had taken me along on the walk to town&#x2014;and it was in the canned-goods section that we encountered Andrew, who was with his mother. Not being of the same generation, Andrew&#x2019;s mother and my grandmother weren&#x2019;t friends, but they knew each other the way people in Riley, Wisconsin, did. Andrew&#x2019;s mother was the one who approached us, setting her hand against her chest and saying to my grandmother, &#x201c;Mrs. Lindgren, it&#x2019;s Florence Imhof. How are you?&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew and I had been classmates for as long as we&#x2019;d been going to school, but we merely eyed each other without speaking. We both were eight. As the adults chatted, he picked up a can of peas and held it by securing it between his flat palm and his chin, and I wondered if he was showing off. <br><br>This was when my grandmother shoved me a little. &#x201c;Alice, say hello to Mrs. Imhof.&#x201d; As I&#x2019;d been taught, I extended my hand. &#x201c;And isn&#x2019;t your daughter darling,&#x201d; my grandmother continued, gesturing toward Andrew, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t believe I know her name.&#x201d; <br><br>A silence ensued during which I&#x2019;m pretty sure Mrs. Imhof was deciding how to correct my grandmother. At last, touching her son&#x2019;s shoulder, Mrs. Imhof said, &#x201c;This is Andrew. He and Alice are in the same class over at the school.&#x201d; <br><br>My grandmother squinted. &#x201c;Andrew, did you say?&#x201d; She even turned her head, angling her ear as if she were hard of hearing, though I knew she wasn&#x2019;t. She seemed to willfully refuse the pardon Mrs. Imhof had offered, and I wanted to tap my grandmother&#x2019;s arm, to tug her over so her face was next to mine and say, &#x201c;Granny, he&#x2019;s a boy!&#x201d; It had never occurred to me that Andrew looked like a girl&#x2014;little about Andrew Imhof had occurred to me at that time in my life&#x2014;but it was true that he had unusually long eyelashes framing hazel eyes, as well as light brown hair that had gotten a bit shaggy over the summer. However, his hair was long only for that time and for a boy; it was still far shorter than mine, and there was nothing feminine about the chinos or red-and-white-checked shirt he wore. <br><br>&#x201c;Andrew is the younger of our two sons,&#x201d; Mrs. Imhof said, and her voice contained a new briskness, the first hint of irritation. &#x201c;His older brother is Pete.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; My grandmother finally appeared to grasp the situation, but grasping it did not seem to have made her repentant. She leaned forward and nodded at Andrew&#x2014;he still was holding the peas&#x2014;and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. You be sure my granddaughter behaves herself at school. You can report back to me if she doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew had said nothing thus far&#x2014;it was not clear he&#x2019;d been paying enough attention to the conversation to understand that his gender was in dispute&#x2014;but at this he beamed: a closed-mouth but enormous smile, one that I felt implied, erroneously, that I was some sort of mischief-maker and he would indeed be keeping his eye on me. My grandmother, who harbored a lifelong admiration for mischief, smiled back at him like a conspirator. After she and Mrs. Imhof said goodbye to each other (our search for hearts of palm had, to my grandmother&#x2019;s disappointment if not her surprise, proved unsuccessful), we turned in the opposite direction from them. I took my grandmother&#x2019;s hand and whispered to her in what I hoped was a chastening tone, &#x201c;Granny.&#x201d; <br><br>Not in a whisper at all, my grandmother said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that child looks like a girl? He&#x2019;s downright pretty!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not his fault, but I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m the first one to make that mistake. His eyelashes are an inch long.&#x201d; <br><br>As if to verify her claim, we both turned around. By then we were thirty feet from the Imhofs, and Mrs. Imhof had her back to us, leaning toward a shelf. But Andrew was facing my grandmother and me. He still was smiling slightly, and when my eyes met his, he lifted his eyebrows twice. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s flirting with you!&#x201d; my grandmother exclaimed. <br><br>&#x201c;What does &#x2018;flirting&#x2019; mean?&#x201d; <br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s when a person likes you, so they try to catch your attention.&#x201d; <br><br>Andrew Imhof liked me? Surely, if the information had been delivered by an adult&#x2014;and not just any adult but my wily grandmother&#x2014;it had to be true. Andrew liking me seemed neither thrilling nor appalling; mostly, it just seemed unexpected. And then, having considered the idea, I dismissed it. My grandmother knew about some things, but not the social lives of eight-year-olds. After all, she hadn&#x2019;t even recognized Andrew as a boy.<br>In the house I grew up in, we were four: my grandmother, my parents, and me. On my father&#x2019;s side, I was a third-generation only child, which was greatly unusual in those days. While I certainly would have liked a sibling, I knew from an early age not to mention it&#x2014;my mother had miscarried twice by the time I was in first grade, and those were just the pregnancies I knew about, the latter occurring when she was five months along. Though the miscarriages weighted my parents with a quiet sadness, our family as it was seemed evenly balanced. At dinner, we each sat on one side of the rectangular table in the dining room; heading up the sidewalk to church, we could walk in pairs; in the summer, we could split a box of Yummi-Freez ice-cream bars; and we could play euchre or bridge, both of which they taught me when I was ten and which we often enjoyed on Friday and Saturday nights. <br><br>Although my grandmother possessed a rowdy streak, my parents were exceedingly considerate and deferential to each other, and for years I believed this mode to be the norm among families and saw all other dynamics as an aberration. My best friend from early girlhood was Dena Janaszewski, who lived across the street, and I was constantly shocked by what I perceived to be Dena&#x2019;s, and really all the Janaszewskis&#x2019;, crudeness and volume: They hollered to one another from between floors and out windows; they ate off one another&#x2019;s plates at will, and Dena and her two younger sisters constantly grabbed and poked at one another&#x2019;s braids and bottoms; they entered the bathroom when it was occupied; and more shocking than the fact that her father once said <i>goddamn</i> in my presence&#x2014;his exact words, entering the kitchen, were &#x201c;Who took my goddamn hedge clippers?&#x201d;&#x2014;was the fact that neither Dena, her mother, nor her sisters seemed to even notice. <br><br>In my own family, life was calm. My mother and father occasionally disagreed&#x2014;a few times a year he would set his mouth in a firm straight line, or the corners of her eyes would draw down with a kind of wounded disappointment&#x2014;but it happened infrequently, and when it did, it seemed unnecessary to express aloud. Merely sensing discord, whether in the role of inflictor or recipient, pained them enough. <br><br>My father had two mottoes, the first of which was &#x201c;Fools&#x2019; names and fools&#x2019; faces often appear in public places.&#x201d; The second was &#x201c;Whatever you are, be a good one.&#x201d; I never knew the source of the first motto, but the second came from Abraham Lincoln. By profession, my father worked as the branch manager of a bank, but his great passion&#x2014;his hobby, I suppose you&#x2019;d say, which seems to be a thing not many people have anymore unless you count searching the Internet or talking on cell phones&#x2014;was bridges. He especially admired the majesty of the Golden Gate Bridge and once told me that during its construction, the contractor had arranged, at great expense, for an enormous safety net to run beneath it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s called employer responsibility,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t just worried about profit.&#x201d; My father closely followed the building of both the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan&#x2014;he called it the Mighty Mac&#x2014;and later, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which, upon completion in 1964, would connect Brooklyn and Staten Island and be the largest suspension bridge in the world. <br><br>My parents both had grown up in Milwaukee and met in 1943, when my mother was eighteen and working in a glove factory, and my father was twenty and working at a branch of Wisconsin State Bank &amp; Trust. They struck up a conversation in a soda shop, and were engaged by the time my father enlisted in the army. After the war ended, they married and moved forty-five miles west to Riley, my father&#x2019;s mother in tow, so he could open a branch of the bank there. My mother never again held a job. As a housewife, she had a light touch&#x2014;she did not seem overburdened or cranky, she didn&#x2019;t remind the rest of us how much she did&#x2014;and yet she sewed many of her own and my clothes, kept the house meticulous, and always prepared our meals. The food we ate was acceptable more often than delicious; she favored pan-broiled steak, or noodle and cheese loafs, and she taught me her recipes in a low-key, literal way, never explaining why I needed to know them. Why <i>wouldn&#x2019;t</i> I need to know them? She was endlessly patient and a purveyor of small, sweet gestures: Without commenting, she&#x2019;d leave pretty ribbons or peppermint candies on my bed or, on my bureau, a single flower in a three-inch vase. <br><br>My mother was the second youngest of eight siblings, none of whom we saw frequently.

Finn advises developing a "tactile-feeling eye" and exercising it whenever possible, "in effect touching . . . with your eyes rather than with your hand"--though if a museum guard is nodding off, a discreet laying-on of hands is also urged. The author's survey of individual works and ways of seeing them, from classical to post-modern and Greek to East Indian, is weak in words but strong in images. When generalizing about the meaning of sculpture in the abstract, Finn fails to convey the special impact of his photographs ("What is remarkable about details in a great figurative work of sculpture is that they ennoble the human form"). But his pictures of nude figures are outstanding, conveying the warmth of flesh in stone. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fable (Prima Official Game Guide)</h2><p><b>Strategies to take you down a path of good or evil, plus a free giant poster</b> <br>�Complete walkthrough.

A top mob boss, a reputed consigliere, and other high-profile members of the Chicago Outfit were accused in a total of eighteen gangland killings, revealing organized crime&#x2019;s ruthless grip on the city throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painting a vivid picture of murder, courtroom drama, family loyalties and disloyalties, journalist Jeff Coen accurately portrays the Chicago Outfit&#x2019;s cold-blooded--and sometimes incompetent--killers and their crimes in the case that brought them down. In 1998 Frank Calabrese Jr. volunteered to wear a wire to gather evidence against his father, a vicious loan shark who strangled most of his victims with a rope before slitting their throats to ensure they were dead. Frank Jr. went after his uncle Nick as well, a calculating but sometimes bumbling hit man who would become one of the highest-ranking turncoats in mob history, admitting he helped strangle, stab, shoot, and bomb victims who got in the mob&#x2019;s way, and turning evidence against his brother Frank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chicago courtroom took on the look and feel of a movie set as Chicago&#x2019;s most colorful mobsters and their equally flamboyant attorneys paraded through and performed: James &#x201c;Jimmy Light&#x201d; Marcello, the acting head of the Chicago mob; Joey &#x201c;the Clown&#x201d; Lombardo, one of Chicago&#x2019;s most eccentric mobsters; Paul &#x201c;the Indian&#x201d; Schiro; and a former Chicago police officer, Anthony &#x201c;Twan&#x201d; Doyle, among others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-creating events from court transcripts, police records, interviews, and notes taken day after day as the story unfolded in court, Coen provides a riveting wide-angle view and one of the best accounts on record of the inner workings of the Chicago syndicate and its control over the city&#x2019;s streets.</p><p><strong>Jeff Coen is a reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> covering federal trials and investigations from the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago. He was present in the courtroom throughout the Family Secrets trial, and his pieces on the case were featured in a popular series in the <i>Chicago</i><i> Tribune.</i> </strong>Coen, a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> reporter, dissects one of the most pivotal mob criminal prosecutions, the Family Secrets case, in his revealing, shocking book on self-destructive Cosa Nostra members engaged in a death dance of suspicion and betrayal. Members of the Chicago Syndicate, also known as the Outfit, under the taut leadership of Frank Calabrese Sr., did their share of graft, bribery, extortion, bookmaking and murder, much like in the glory Capone days, but in 1998, Calabresi's son Frank Jr.&#x2014;who had had it with his father's abusive ways and broken promises&#x2014;decided to become an FBI turncoat and get the goods on his father and the powerful men around him. Giving an unfettered glimpse into the strata of the Chicago criminal organization, Coen tallies the strategies of the clever mob mouthpieces, the extensive wise guy body count, and the Feds' relentless pursuit through the indictment and sentencing. Superbly crafted, this is a tragic, clear-sighted account of how Chicago's mighty mob was brought to heel.

Tour.</p><p>A deliciously wicked take on casino/real-estate mogul Donald J. Trump. Drawing on a wealth of sources, Hurt (For All Mankind, 1988, etc.) offers an exhaustive, gossipy rundown on a golden boy of the so-called greed decade who lost his touch--and way--in the hard realities of the 1990's. Capitalizing on political contacts made by his father, who amassed a fortune building and managing apartment houses for working-class residents of N.Y.C.'s outer boroughs, the erstwhile Wunderkind made a flashy name for himself in Manhattan property development. Moving on to Atlantic City's glittery gambling dens, the cocksure Trump (who turns 47 this June) took a great fall when his faith in ever-rising asset prices proved unfounded. In the wake of an acrimonious divorce that ended a 13- year marriage to the Czech-born Ivana (inducing bankers to review Trump's balance sheet with greater care), the ambitious hustler's leveraged empire and its trophy holdings now languish in undeclared bankruptcy. While Hurt doesn't wholly dismiss the possibility of a comeback, he leaves little doubt that Trump is bucking tough odds. Nor does the author overlook many opportunities to dish the dirt on his subject's star-crossed personal life and dubious business practices. Cases in point range from the Trump family's long- standing ties to organized-crime figures through The Donald's fling with Marla Maples; inability to weigh a deal's downside risks against its potential rewards; midnight demolition of a Manhattan landmark; and world-class talent for manipulation. Lacking the insider's edge of John R. O'Donnell's Trumped! (1991)--but, still, a slick, informed account of an upstart wheeler-dealer whose brass may be exceeded only by his reach. (Photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Why are so many people writing "interim" biographies of Trump? Presumably because Trump is a flamboyant case of truth being sometimes stranger than fiction and because there is a vast audience for whom his every move is of enormous interest. One hesitates to use the word biography to describe this book. It is more a roundup of what is known to date about the famous financier and playboy, culled from a variety of sources. The chances are that most readers already have seen or heard, somewhere and sometimes in spite of themselves, most of what Hurt has to report. Right now, Trump seems to be down. Will he remain there? Stay tuned. Someone will be sure to let us know. Best to wait until the requests mount up before adding this one to the collection. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 1/93.<br><i>- A.J.

His vivid and energetic record of that experience, The Making of a Chef, takes us to the heart of this food-knowledge mecca. Here we meet a coterie of talented chefs, an astonishing and driven breed. Ruhlman learns fundamental skills and information about the behavior of food that make cooking anything possible. Ultimately, he propels himself and his readers through a score of kitchens and classrooms, from Asian and American regional cuisines to lunch cookery and even table waiting, in search of the elusive, unnameable elements of great cooking.<br></p><p>Journalist Michael Ruhlman talked his way into the CIA: the Culinary Institute of America, the Harvard of cooking schools. It had something to do with potatoes a grand-uncle had eaten deacades earlier, how the man could remember them so well for so long, buried as they had been in the middle of an elegant meal. Ruhlman wanted to learn how to cook potatoes like that--like an art--and the CIA seemed the place to go. The fun part of this book is that we all get to go along for the ride without having to endure the trauma of cooking school.<p> Ever wonder what goes on in a busy kitchen, why your meal comes late or shows up poorly cooked? The temptation is to blame the waiter, but there are a world of cooks behind those swinging doors, and Ruhlman marches you right into it. It's a world where, when everything is going right, time halts and consciousness expands. And when a few things go wrong, the earth begins to wobble on its axis. Ruhlamn has the writerly skills to make the education of a chef a visceral experience.</p>In the ultimate food-lover&#39;s fantasy, journalist Michael Ruhlman dons chef&#39;s jacket and houndstooth-check pants to join the students in Skills One at the Culinary Institute of America, the most influential cooking school in the country. His goal is to document the training of America&#39;s chefs from the first classroom to the Culinary&#39;s final kitchen, the American Bounty Restaurant. The result becomes more than a rote reportage of a school for cooks. Ruhlman learns to cook as though his future depends upon it, and this complete immersion enables him to create the most vivid and energetic memoir of a genuine culinary education on record. He learns fundamental skills and information about the behavior of food that make cooking anything possible. But he also finds that a professional cook needs more than just knowledge and skill. Ultimately Ruhlman propels himself and his readers through a score of kitchens and classrooms, from Asian and American regional cuisines to lunch cookery and even table waiting, in search of the elusive, unnameable elements of great cooking.</p><h2>Stephen King: Three Novels - Carrie, Salem&#39;s Lot, The Shining</h2><p>Overview One of the best-selling authors of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Stephen King has made a career out of thrilling readers with his dark and disturbing masterpieces of the macabre. Stephen King: Three Novels brings together King&#39;s first three published novels for a trilogy of terror unparalleled in modern fiction. Carrie is the story of Carrie White, an outcast and alienated high-school student who discovers that she possesses formidable paranormal powers. While Carrie struggles privately to understand the full scope of her wild talents, her classmates escalate their cruel taunts, provoking her in dangerous ways that no one could dream of in their worst nightmares. In Salem&#39;s Lot, writer Ben Mears returns to his hometown in Maine to write a book on the local Marsten House, the site of an unsettling childhood experience that has haunted him ever since. The Marsten House has recently been purchased by an unseen new owner, and when the townspeople begin disappear</p><p></p><h2>Nature in the Neighborhood</h2><p>In a book as beautiful as it is informative, author and nature artist Gordon Morrison reveals the diversity and abundance of life that can be found as nearby as your own backyard. As the seasons change, readers learn how the stories and life cycles of each of the plants and animal families in the neighborhood change too. Filled with lovely, detailed illustrations and overflowing with information, Nature in the Neighborhood invites readers to look closely and enjoy the beauty of nature all around them.</p><p>Gordon Morrison is a well-known naturalist whose work has been praised by Roger Tory Peterson as "Marvelous, beautiful, excellent . . . Morrison&#x2019;s work is so inspiring that I wish such clear material was available when I was slowly learning ecology. . . . We owe a debt of gratitude to Gordon for his interpretive skills as an artist. He is a superb teacher who uses visual methods." Robert Bateman likened his work to that of Albrecht Durer and Andrew Wyeth. Gordon Morrison makes his home in Massachusetts.Grade 1-4&#x2013;While most books about habitats consider vast territories such as rain forests or tundra, Morrison calls attention to the workings of nature close to home. He focuses on plants and animals in a single neighborhood in an unnamed North American city, beginning in spring as the snow melts and following them through the seasons. A robin nests in a fire-alarm box. Weeds claim an empty lot. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed plants. Two detailed maps of the neighborhood help readers locate the sites described. Full-color illustrations and standard type move the narration along. Lower on the pages, tiny black-and-white drawings are accompanied by more detailed descriptions of the animals and plants as well as explanations of concepts such as habitat. This format expands the title's usefulness to a broader range of children, depending on their interest and reading ability. At times, however, the amount of information threatens to distract from the main account. Still, this offering could serve as a resource for nature study or community units and will encourage readers to observe and appreciate their own surroundings.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her antiques business is thriving, she's beginning to make some close friends, and her relationship with the local police chief is becoming more interesting.

Josie is sponsoring the Portsmouth Women's Guild Annual Black and Gold Gala and is looking forward to receiving a kindly worded thank-you for her efforts. Instead, the Guild representative, Maisy Gaylor, dies a horrible death in the midst of the banquet. Who could have wanted to kill earnest, drab little Maisy? "Funny, isn't it," muses the hostile Detective Rowcliff, "how a lot of people end up dead when no one has any enemies."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone who had access to the wine Maisy drank, including Josie herself, soon comes under suspicion. Can Josie manage to ferret out the truth, keep her business running smoothly, and continue to put down roots in her new town, or will everything prove too much for her to handle on her own?</p><p>Jane K.

The author of one previous mystery, <i>Consigned to Death,</i> she is on the board of directors of the New York chapter of the Mystery Writers of America and is the chair of Wolfe Pack literary awards.Chapter One&nbsp;"So," Detective Rowcliff asked, "did you kill her?"&nbsp;My lips parted, but no words came. I'd seen poor little mousy Maisy Gaylor collapse and die at tonight's Gala, and the horror of it was with me still. "What are you saying?" I managed. "Didn't she have a heart attack? Or a stroke? Or something?"&nbsp;"Probably not."&nbsp;"What do you mean?" I asked, confused and frightened.&nbsp;"Let's stay on track here," he said impatiently, ignoring my question, his foot rat-a-tatting a staccato beat. "Did you kill her?"&nbsp;"No, of course not," I said. "My God, no."&nbsp;He stared at me, his eyes boring into mine. "Tell me what you saw," he said coldly.&nbsp;I was so scared, I could barely breathe. I glanced away, then back at him, hoping for some sign of empathy or understanding. There was none. "What do you want to know?" I asked.&nbsp;"How did Maisy end up onstage?"&nbsp;I shut my eyes, letting the picture come.&nbsp;My company's auction hall was decorated to the teeth in honor of the Portsmouth Women's Guild's Annual Black and Gold Gala. Even the banner stretched high over the stage was color-matched--the words prescott's welcomes you were stamped in gold on a black silk background.&nbsp;Dimmed chandeliers and wall sconces cast a soft glow and scores of candles flickered in tall crystal holders. Gilt-edged dishes, polished silver, and etched glasses gleamed in the amber light.&nbsp;We were ready to go by six and guests started arriving about six thirty. By seven, clusters of people stood in small groupings near the antiques display. A brass quartet played classical music softly in the corner. Glasses clinked and people laughed. All around me, chitchat undulated in the background.&nbsp;Most of the women wore all-black gowns, but several twinkled in black with gold sequins or metallic beads. All of the male guests wore black tie, and to keep to the black-and-gold color scheme, my male staff wore black suits with gold ties and the females, me included, wore long black skirts with gold silk jerseys.&nbsp;A tuxedoed waiter passed by and I snared a flute of champagne. I scanned the room, seeking out people I hadn't yet met and trying hard to remember the names of those I had.&nbsp;Just before we were called to sit for dinner, Maisy Gaylor, the Portsmouth Women's Guild's representative, approached me, grinning like a girl. She was wearing a fitted black dress, snug and cut low--an uncharacteristically sexy look for the normally all-business professional woman.&nbsp;"Oh, Josie," she exclaimed, playfully grasping my arm. "We did it! All these weeks planning and working, and here we are! Aren't you just so excited?"&nbsp;"Absolutely!" I agreed, smiling, her enthusiasm contagious.&nbsp;"Oh, look! There's Britt!" Maisy flitted away in Britt's direction. Britt Epps, the honorary chair of the Gala and the most influential lawyer in town, was looking downright dapper, his bulk well disguised in a custom-made tuxedo. I watched as they air-kissed.&nbsp;Later, after I'd greeted and chatted with dozens of attendees and finished a pretty good dinner, I realized that the event was on track to be a roaring success--the leaders of Portsmouth's social scene had come to my venue and were, by all appearances, having fun, which was excellent news for me, and they seemed to be bidding well on the antiques, which was excellent news for the Guild.&nbsp;As the waiters cleared dishes, refilling wine for those of us who wanted more and pouring coffee for those who didn't, I sat idly chatting with my seatmate. Just as I picked up my dessert fork, my assistant, Gretchen, rushed across the room in my direction.&nbsp;"All set!" she said, her emerald green eyes sparkling with delight, handing me the envelope containing the names of the winning bidders.&nbsp;"Great!" I responded. Without opening it, I passed it on to Britt.&nbsp;He stood up and leaned over to Maisy, seated at the table next to ours. "Maisy," he said in a stage whisper, waving the envelope to catch her eye. "We're ready to announce the winners."&nbsp;Maisy jumped right up, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. Britt turned and motioned to Dora Reynolds, holding the envelope high above his head to flag her attention. Dora, the volunteer in charge of the event, nodded her understanding. She looked forty but was probably on the shady side of fifty. She was all gussied up in a full-length black silk slip dress that glittered with gold sparkles. As she approached us, she cooed to various people, working the room like a pro.&nbsp;"I bet you've won the tureen!" she called to someone. "I have a witchy feeling about it! You'll see!"&nbsp;Maisy squeezed Britt's hand. "I'm just so excited!" she exclaimed, beaming. "And curious!"&nbsp;"Want to venture a guess as to how much we'll bring in tonight?" Britt teased.&nbsp;Maisy giggled. "Oh, no! I just hope it's a big number!"&nbsp;When Dora arrived at the front, Britt asked, "Ready, girls?" sounding more like a stage manager at a burlesque show than an important lawyer hosting a serious charity's most significant fund-raiser.&nbsp;"Can I see the bid sheets before we announce the winners?" Dora asked.&nbsp;"Of course," Britt replied, and handed her the envelope.&nbsp;I stood with Maisy and Britt, barely listening to their nothing sayings while Dora thumbed through the bid sheets and slipped them back into the envelope. I sat. They filed onto the stage. Britt went first, his chest puffed out with pride and pleasure, followed by Dora, ethereal as always, almost gliding. Maisy brought up the rear, lifting the hem of her low-cut gown as she stepped up onto the low platform.&nbsp;Just as Britt approached the podium, before he spoke a word and without warning, Maisy choked, uttered a desperate shriek, and tumbled forward, her wineglass shattering. She landed in a heap near my chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Rowcliff began to tap his pencil, startling me out of my reverie. I opened my eyes and turned to him. He was chewing gum, as if he wanted to kill it, while watching me through uncaring eyes.&nbsp;"So?" he prompted, sounding annoyed.&nbsp;Taking a deep breath, I recounted the events of the night, answering his question about how Maisy had ended up on the stage.&nbsp;"And then people rushed up and--" I faltered, unsure what to say next.&nbsp;Rowcliff continued to tap his pencil, thinking about what I'd said. "Who wants Maisy dead?" he asked abruptly.&nbsp;"No one. I mean, I didn't know her very well, but I can't imagine that anyone would want to murder her."&nbsp;His angry eyes challenged me. "Well then," he demanded with a fierce rat-a-tat of his pencil, "who wants you dead?"&nbsp;Chapter Two&nbsp;stared at him. What is he saying? His question makes no sense. He stared back at me, watching me, waiting for my response.&nbsp;"What?" I asked, giving voice to my confusion.&nbsp;"I asked, 'Who wants you dead?' Got any enemies?"&nbsp;"Why would you ask me that?"&nbsp;"Answer the question," Rowcliff commanded.&nbsp;"What has Maisy's death got to do with whether I have enemies?" I insisted.&nbsp;He shrugged. "Maybe nothing. I'm just asking questions, trying to cover all bases." He paused, giving me a chance to speak, then added, waggling his fingers to hurry me up, "So . . . ? Who wants you dead?"&nbsp;"No one," I said, my voice barely audible.&nbsp;"Right. No one ever wants to kill anyone," he said in an irritatingly sardonic tone. "Funny, isn't it, how a lot of people end up dead when no one has any enemies."&nbsp;"Enemies? Are you saying that Maisy was killed by some enemy? Or are you saying that Maisy was killed by mistake and I'm the one with an enemy?"&nbsp;He shifted position and tapped his pencil a few times against the table. "I'm not saying anything." After a long pause and a short series of taps, he said, "Describe her to me. What was she like?"&nbsp;I considered how to express my jumbled thoughts. Maisy Gaylor had been my chief contact within the Portsmouth Women's Guild, and I couldn't recall that we'd ever shared a lighthearted moment, so it had been something of a shock to see her flitting about at the Gala, vivacious and effervescent. From my prior experience, I'd found her to be a painfully earnest, drab little woman, always quiet and often grim. Her atypical buoyancy had made me wonder at the time if she was high. And when she tumbled off the stage and died, I had the fleeting thought that maybe she had taken drugs and they'd killed her.&nbsp;"I didn't know her well," I explained, offering a disclaimer. "But she seemed more high-spirited than usual. I couldn't help but wonder if she had taken something."&nbsp;Another riff of rat-a-tat-tat. "Okay. Let's back up. How long have you known her?"&nbsp;"About . . . four months. Once I accepted the sponsorship."&nbsp;"Sponsorship of what? The Guild?"&nbsp;"Not exactly . . . not the entire organization. My company sponsored the Gala."&nbsp;"Which was a fund-raiser for the Guild."&nbsp;"That's right."&nbsp;He picked up the gilt-framed program that listed the evening's dinner menu, the Guild and Gala officers, the names of the musicians in the New Hampshire Brass Quartet, and the sponsors. He tapped the bottom of the program, indicating that he'd located my company's name. "Prescott's Antiques: Auctions and Appraisals," he read aloud. "Josie Prescott, president."&nbsp;"Right."&nbsp;"What does that mean--sponsoring? You pay the bills?"&nbsp;"Well, yes. Some of them. I mean, the caterer discounted the food and the printer comped the invitations and the programs, but sponsoring an event like this involves more than just cash. This room," I said, gesturing, "is where we hold our monthly antiques auctions, so we're providing the physical space. We also donated some of the antiques that were auctioned off tonight. Plus, we researched all of them and prepared and produced the catalog."&nbsp;He dropped the program on the table as if it were garbage and shifted in his seat. "Why?" he asked combatively. "Why be a sponsor?"&nbsp;My father taught me that in business, as in personal relationships, it's crucial to deal only in facts. When someone attacks your motive for doing something, he instructed, respond with facts. Don't get defensive. Don't attack back. Don't let your emotional reaction show in any way. Stay calm and stick to the facts. I took a calming breath and reassured myself that no matter what Rowcliff was insinuating, there was nothing shameful about promoting my company's services.&nbsp;"To help the Guild," I replied. "And to get my company's name out."&nbsp;He picked up his pencil and gave a tap-tap, thinking what to ask next. "Were you and Maisy friends?" he asked.&nbsp;"Not really. We worked together."&nbsp;"No socializing, no lunches, no chitchat?" he asked, and from his demeanor, I had the sense that except for police-mandated standards, he would have added, like most broads.&nbsp;"No. None. When we were together, we talked business."&nbsp;He half-sneered in disbelief. Yeah, right, I could almost hear him thinking, women--all business--I doubt it. He punctuated his disdain with a quick tap-tap of his pencil. "Well then," he said, "let's try this. When did you first see her today?"&nbsp;I ignored his attitude and focused on answering his question. "She got here early--midafternoon."&nbsp;"When exactly?"&nbsp;"About three thirty or four. She was excited and fluttered about, touching this and that, arranging flowers and so on." I smiled at the memory. She'd been almost giddy. "Mostly, to tell you the truth, she got in the way." I shrugged.&nbsp;"Did you talk to her?"&nbsp;"Then?"&nbsp;"Ever."&nbsp;"Sure. Lots. But not about anything special."&nbsp;"Give me an example."&nbsp;"Okay," I said. "About five, she asked me if I thought we had enough wine and I told her yes. Just before we sat down to dinner, she told me that she thought someone whose name I don't remember would bid over the estimate on the three-piece faience pottery set." I shrugged. "Things like that. Little nothings."&nbsp;"What's a faience pottery set?" he asked.&nbsp;"Faience is the French term for tin-glazed earthenware. This set includes two fruit dishes and a bowl. It's incredibly rare."&nbsp;"How much is it worth?"&nbsp;"About twenty-five hundred."&nbsp;"You're kidding!"&nbsp;I smiled. "Nope. Britt still has the auction sheets, I think, so you can see for yourself how it did."&nbsp;"Why is it so valuable?"&nbsp;"Aside from the fact that it's beautiful, the design is crisp and clean, and it's in perfect condition. Think about it--it's two hundred and fifty years old and it's unchipped and uncracked." I pointed. "Do you see it there?" He turned and tilted his head, squinting a little. "Notice how pure and bright the colors look even from this distance."&nbsp;He nodded. "What else?"&nbsp;"About the pottery?"&nbsp;"No," he said, exasperated. "About Maisy."&nbsp;I thought for a moment. "She told me a couple of times how great she thought the Gala was going." I shrugged again. "Nothing remarkable at all. I can't remember anything else."&nbsp;He glared at me for a long moment, then stood up and looked around. "Looks like just about everyone's gone. Let's call it a night." He stood, shook out his pant leg, gestured to Officer Johnston, who was dutifully taking notes on the other side of the table, to follow him, and headed for the rear doors. I hunched my shoulders as a rush of icy air reached me. October in New Hampshire can be bone-chillingly cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the remaining guests and workers were processed out and Detective Rowcliff gave his final instructions to the police officers assigned to overnight sentry duty, he followed me through the warehouse into the main office and watched as I got ready to set the alarm.&nbsp;He informed me in a tone that begged for argument that I had to leave my auction venue--to him a crime scene--unalarmed so the police could enter at will.&nbsp;"No problem," I responded.&nbsp;I retrieved my purse from where I'd placed it under a desk and turned to leave.&nbsp;"When will you get in tomorrow?" he asked. He still seemed angry about something, but I figured that was his natural state, so I ignored it.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Midnight</h2><p><p><strong>New poetry and prose from a most acclaimed experimental American poet.</strong></p> In <em>The Midnight</em>'s amply illustrated five sections, three of poetry and two of prose, we find&#x2015;swirling around the poet's mother&#x2015;ghosts, family photographs, whispers, interjections, bed hangings, unfinished lace, the fly-leaves of old books, <em>The Master of Ballantrae</em>, the Yeats brothers, Emily Dickinson, Lewis Carroll, Lady Macbeth, Thomas Sheridan, Michael Drayton, Frederick Law Olmsted: a restless brood confronting, absorbing, and refracting history and language. With shades of wit, insomnia, and terror, <em>The Midnight</em> becomes a kind of dialogue in which the prose and poetry sections seem to be dreaming fitfully of each other.</p><p>Author of more than a dozen books of poetry and two of literary criticism, Susan Howe's recent collection of poems That This, published by New Directions won the Bollingen Prize in 2011. Her earlier critical study, My Emily Dickinson, was re-issued in 2007 with an introduction by Eliot Weinberger. Three CDs in collaboration with the musician/composer David Grubbs, Thiefth,&nbsp;Souls of the Labadie Tract, and Frolic Architecture&nbsp;were released on the Blue Chopsticks label (2005; 2011). Howe held the Samuel P. Capen Chair in Poetry and the Humanities at the State University New York at Buffalo until her retirement in 2007. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999 and served as a Chancellor to the Academy of American Poets between 2000-2006. In fall, 2009 she was awarded a Fellowship to the American Academy at Berlin. Grenfell Press published a fine press edition of &#x201c;Frolic Architecture with photographic prints by James Welling in 2009. Recently she was an Artist In Residence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. In October, 2013 her word collages were exhibited at the Yale Union in Portland, Oregon, and in the Whitney Biennial Spring, 2014. A limited press edition of Tom Tit Tot (the word collages which amount to a series poem) with art work by R.H. Quaytman has just been published by MoMA in New York, and Spontaneous Particulars:The Telepathy of Archives, (2014) published by Christine Burgin and New Directions.Howe continues to unsettle easy assumptions about contemporary experimental American poetry, and, simultaneously, origin myths of the U.S., with carefully measured doses of early history, national and personal: "I am assembling materials for a recurrent return somewhere. Familiar sound textures, deliverances, vagabond quotations, preservations, wilderness shrubs, little resuscitated patterns. Historical or miraculous. Thousands of correlations have to be sliced and spliced." More immediately autobiographical and less uniform than books like The Europe of Trusts or Pierce-Arrow, Howe's latest can seem scattered on a first reading, but soon resolves itself into a remarkably cohesive invitation to imagine oneself into historical roles that have been laid away in books: "Come away-This way, this way-Calvinists, Congregationalists, Anabaptists, Ranters, Quakers, Shakers, Sandemans, Rosicrucians, Pietists, reformers, pilgrims, traveling preachers, strolling players, peddlers, pirates, captives, mystics, embroiderers, upholsterers, itinerant singers, penmen, imposters." Howe finds resonance in the smallest inscription on a family ledger, taking as guidance Emersonian aphorism: "The poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought." The smallest details thus come to replace the big picture, as when hearing a midnight sound "echoed and re-echoed only." Like Agnes Varda in her film The Gleaners and I, Howe demonstrates that the artist's unpredictable path to knowledge, generous in its digressions and attentions to the obscure, is revealing, suspenseful and necessary. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Streams in the Desert</h2><p>In a barren wilderness, L. B. Cowman long ago discovered a fountain that sustained her, and she shared it with the world, Streams in the Desert -- her collection of prayerful meditations, Christian writings, and God&#39;s written promises--has become one of the most dearly loved, best-selling devotionals of all time since its first publication in 1925. Filled with insight into the richness of God&#39;s provision and the purpose of His plan, this enduring classic has encouraged and inspired generations of Christians. I heard the flow of hidden springs; before me palms rose green and fair; The birds were singing; all the air was filled and stirred with angels&#39; wings. Now James Reimann, editor of the highly acclaimed updated edition of My Utmost for His Highest by Oswald Chambers, again brings us the wisdom of the past in the language of today, by introducing this updated edition of Streams in the Desert. With fresh, contemporary wording and precise NIV text, the timeless message of the original flows unhindered through these pages, lending guidance and hope to a new generation of believers. We never know where God has hidden His streams. We see a large stone and have no idea that it covers the source of a spring. We see a rocky areas and never imagine that it is hiding a fountain. God leads me into hard and difficult places, and it is there I realize I am where eternal streams abide. Day by day, Streams in the Desert will lead you from life&#39;s dry desolate places to the waters of the River of Life -- and beyond, to their very Source.</p><p>The late Mrs. Charles E. Cowman wrote the beloved, classic devotional Streams in the Desert. She served with her husband in Japan as a missionary until his illness forced the couple to return to the United StatesStreams in the Desert is a powerful collection of meditations, Christian writings, and Scripture, and remains one of the most beloved devotionals of all time. This updated edition, however, offers even more, including Scripture, Subject, and Contributors Indexes. Author L. B. Cowman thoughtfully and prayerfully chose the Scripture and penned or selected the meditations she knew would provide a river of wisdom, encouragement, and inspiration to weary desert travelers. Those words are still clearly relevant in today&#39;s world, where people thirst more than ever for reassurance and guidance. In this updated edition, however, editor Jim Reimann lovingly combines contemporary wording and precise NIV text to help introduce a whole new generation of believers to the timeless messages of God&#39;s faithfulness. Easy-to-read yet true to the essence of the original, this Streams in the Desert offers a refreshing daily dip into God&#39;s purpose, plan, and enduring promise. And now this classic content takes on a classic look. The deluxe edition is bound in stunning Italian Duo-Tone---the perfect accent for the beautiful and ageless messages of hope found inside.</p><h2>The Story of Painting: From Cave Painting to Modern Times</h2><p>Beautifully illustrated. large heavy book</p><p></p><h2>Hunter: The Vigil</h2><p>Candle in the Darkness The scales have fallen from your eyes.

Her name was Emily Danagger. She&#x2019;d been murdered in her early teens, by a contractor working on her parents&#x2019; house. Her body was stuffed into the attic wall and plastered over.<br>I blink and mutter a vague answer to whatever question the girl next to me just asked. Emily&#x2019;s cheekbones were higher. And the nose is different. But the shape of the face is so similar, it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m staring at the girl I tracked into the upstairs guest room. It took the better part of an hour, hacking with the athame at wall after wall as she seeped out of it, quietly trying to get behind me.<br>&#x201c;I love monster movies,&#x201d; says the girl beside me whose name I can&#x2019;t remember. &#x201c;Jigsaw and Jason are definitely my favorites. What about you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t much care for monster movies,&#x201d; I reply, and don&#x2019;t mention that neither Jigsaw nor Jason is technically a monster. &#x201c;I like explosions, special effects.&#x201d;<br>Cait Hecht. That&#x2019;s this girl&#x2019;s name. She&#x2019;s another junior at Winston Churchill. She has hazel eyes, sort of too big for her face, but pretty. I don&#x2019;t know what color Emily Danagger&#x2019;s eyes were. By the time I met her, all the blood had leaked out of them. I remember her face, pale but not sightless, materializing through faded flower-print wallpaper. Now it seems dumb, but at the time it was the most intense game of dead-girl whack-a-mole ever. I was covered in sweat. It was a long time ago, when I was younger and more easily rattled. It would still be years before I&#x2019;d go up against ghosts of any real strength&#x2014;ghosts like Anna Korlov, the girl who could have torn out my spine anytime she liked, but wound up saving me instead.<br>I&#x2019;m sitting in the corner booth of a coffee shop off Bay Street. Carmel&#x2019;s across from me with two of her friends, Jo and Chad, who I think have been a couple since seventh grade. Gross. Beside me, Cait Hecht is supposed to be my date. We just saw a movie; I don&#x2019;t remember what it was about but I think there were giant dogs in it. She&#x2019;s talking to me with oversized gestures, cocked eyebrows, and teeth made perfect by a childhood full of retainers, trying to keep my attention. But all I can think is how much she looks like Emily Danagger, except far less interesting.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; she says awkwardly, &#x201c;how&#x2019;s your coffee?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; I reply. I try to smile. None of this is her fault. Carmel&#x2019;s the one who talked me into this farce, and I&#x2019;m the one who went along with it to shut her up. I feel like an ass for wasting Cait&#x2019;s time. I feel like a bigger ass for secretly comparing her to a dead girl I killed four years ago.<br>The conversation stalls. I take a long drink of my coffee, which really is good. Full of sugar and whipped cream and hazelnut. Under the table, Carmel kicks me and I almost spill it down my chin. When I look up she&#x2019;s talking to Jo and Chad, but she meant to do it. I&#x2019;m not being a proper date. There&#x2019;s a tic starting underneath her left eye.<br>I briefly contemplate making polite conversation. But I don&#x2019;t want to encourage this, or lead Cait on. It&#x2019;s a mystery why she wanted to go out with me anyway. After what happened to Mike, Will, and Chase last year&#x2014;Mike getting murdered by Anna, and Will and Chase eaten by the ghost that killed my father&#x2014;I&#x2019;m the pariah of Winston Churchill. I was never linked to their murders, but everyone suspects. They know that those guys hated me, and that they ended up dead.<br>There are actual theories about what might have happened, big, swirling rumors that circulate and grow before finally reaching epically ridiculous proportions and dying off. It was drugs, people whisper. No, no, it was an underground sex ring. Cas was supplying them with amphetamines so they could perform better. He&#x2019;s like a druggie pimp.<br>People pass me in the halls and avoid my eyes. They whisper in my wake. Sometimes I second-guess my decision to finish high school in Thunder Bay. I can&#x2019;t stand that these idiots have all these theories, most of them outlandish to the extreme, yet none of them have thought to mention the ghost story that they all knew. No one has ever talked about Anna Dressed in Blood. That, at least, would be a rumor worth listening to.<br>Some days, I open my mouth to tell my mom to get ready, to find us another house in another city where I could be hunting any number of the murderous dead. We&#x2019;d have packed up months ago had it not been for Thomas and Carmel. Despite all efforts to the contrary, I&#x2019;ve come to rely on Thomas Sabin and Carmel Jones. It&#x2019;s weird to think that the girl across the table, giving me secret dagger eyes, started out as just a mark. Just a way to know the town. It&#x2019;s weird to think that I once saw Thomas, my best friend, as an annoying, psychic tagalong.<br>Carmel nudges me again and I glance at the clock. Barely five minutes have passed since the last time I looked. I think it might be broken. When Cait&#x2019;s fingers slide against my wrist, I pull away and take a drink of my coffee. I don&#x2019;t miss the embarrassed and uncomfortable shift of her body when I do it.<br>All of a sudden, Carmel says loudly, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Cas has even researched colleges yet. Have you, Cas?&#x201d; She kicks me harder this time. What is she talking about? I&#x2019;m still a junior. Why would I be thinking about college? Of course, Carmel has probably had her future planned out since preschool.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking about St. Lawrence,&#x201d; Cait says when I just sit there. &#x201c;My dad says St. Clair might be better. But I don&#x2019;t know what he means by <i>better</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mm,&#x201d; I say. Carmel&#x2019;s looking at me like I&#x2019;m some kind of idiot. I almost laugh. She means well, but I have absolutely zero to say to these people. I wish Thomas were here. When the phone in my pocket starts buzzing, I jump up from the table too fast. They&#x2019;ll start talking about me the minute I&#x2019;m out the door, wondering what my problem is, and Carmel will tell them I&#x2019;m just nervous. Whatever.<br>It&#x2019;s Thomas calling.<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Are you mind reading again, or is this just good timing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That bad, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No worse than I thought it would be. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br>I can almost feel him shrug through the phone. &#x201c;Nothing. Just thought you might want an escape route. I got the car out of the shop this afternoon. It could probably take us down to Grand Marais now.&#x201d;<br>It&#x2019;s on the tip of my tongue to say, &#x201c;What do you mean, <i>probably</i>?&#x201d; when the door of the coffee shop opens and Carmel glides out.<br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; I mutter.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Carmel&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br>She stops in front of me with her arms crossed over her chest. Thomas&#x2019;s tiny voice is chirping, wanting to know what&#x2019;s going on, whether he should swing by my house and pick me up, or not. Before Carmel can say anything, I put the phone back to my ear and tell him yes.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Carmel makes our excuses for us. In her Audi, she manages to keep up the silent treatment for all of forty seconds as she drives through the Thunder Bay streets. As we go, there&#x2019;s that odd coincidence of the streetlights turning on just ahead of us, like an enchanted escort. The roads are wet, still crunchy with lingering ice patches at the shoulders. Summer vacation starts in two weeks, but the town doesn&#x2019;t seem to know it. Late May and temps still dip below freezing at night. The only indication that winter is ending are the storms: screaming, wind-driven things that go out over the lake and swing back in again, rinsing away the wreck of winter sludge. I wasn&#x2019;t ready for so many months of cold. It clamps around the city like a fist.<br>&#x201c;Why did you even bother to come?&#x201d; Carmel asks. &#x201c;If you were just going to act like that? You made Cait feel really bad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>We</i> made Cait feel really bad. I never wanted to do this in the first place. You were the one who got her hopes up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s liked you since chemistry last semester,&#x201d; Carmel says, scowling.<br>&#x201c;Then you should have told her what an ass I am. Made me sound like a moronic jerk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better to let her see it for herself. You barely said five words to anyone.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s got this disappointed squint on her face that&#x2019;s hovering close to disgust. Then her expression softens and she pushes her blond hair off of her shoulder. &#x201c;I just thought it would be nice if you got out and met some new people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I meet plenty of new people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I mean living people.&#x201d;<br>I stare straight ahead. Maybe she meant that as a jibe about Anna, and maybe she didn&#x2019;t. But it pisses me off. Carmel wants me to forget. To forget that Anna saved all of our lives, that she sacrificed herself and dragged the Obeahman down to Hell. Carmel, Thomas, and I have been trying to figure out what happened to her after that night, without much luck. I guess Carmel thinks it&#x2019;s time to stop looking and let her go. But I won&#x2019;t. Whether I&#x2019;m supposed to or not doesn&#x2019;t matter.<br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to leave, you know,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve had Thomas pick me up there. Or I could have walked.&#x201d;<br>Carmel chews her pretty lip, used to getting her way. We&#x2019;ve been friends for most of the year now, and she still gets this puzzled puppy face when I don&#x2019;t just do what she says. It&#x2019;s strangely endearing.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold out. And it was boring anyway.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s unruffled in her camel peacoat and red mittens. The red scarf at her neck is carefully knotted, despite the fact that we left in a hurry. &#x201c;I was ...</p><h2>The Visual Handbook of Energy Conservation: A Comprehensive Guide to Reducing Energy Use at Home</h2><p><p>From the author of the best-selling <strong><i>The Visual Handbook of Building and Remodeling</i></strong> (over 300,000 copies sold in all three editions), comes a new book in the same graphic format that explains how to reduce energy use in the home.

Despite the fact that it's often a hard sell at first (what teenager wouldn't cringe at the thought of 400-plus pages of talking rabbits?), Richard Adams's bunny-centric epic rarely fails to win the love and respect of anyone who reads it, regardless of age. Like most great novels, <i>Watership Down</i> is a rich story that can be read (and reread) on many different levels. The book is often praised as an allegory, with its analogs between human and rabbit culture (a fact sometimes used to goad skeptical teens, who resent the challenge that they won't "get" it, into reading it), but it's equally praiseworthy as just a corking good adventure.<p> The story follows a warren of Berkshire rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a land developer. As they search for a safe haven, skirting danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band and its compelling culture and mythos. Adams has crafted a touching, involving world in the dirt and scrub of the English countryside, complete with its own folk history and language (the book comes with a "lapine" glossary, a guide to rabbitese). As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, <i>Watership Down</i> will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Pharmacophilia or The Natural Paradises</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Espresso Tales: The Latest from 44 Scotland Street</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p><p>ALEXANDER MCCALL SMITH is the author of the international phenomenon The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie Series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series and the Corduroy Mansions series.

The forward movement of the year, so tentative in the early months of spring, now seemed quite relentless. The longest day, which always seemed to arrive indecently early, had passed in a bluster of wind and light rain, but had been followed by a glorious burst of warmth that penetrated the very stones of Edinburgh.<br><br> Out on the pavements, small clusters of tables and chairs appeared here and there, populated by knots of people who could hardly believe that they were sitting outside, in Scotland, in late summer. All of them knew that this simply could not last. September was not far off, and after that, as was well-known to all but the most confused, was October - and darkness. And Scottish weather, true to its cultural traditions, made one thing abundantly clear: you paid for what you enjoyed, and you usually paid quite promptly. This was a principle which was inevitably observed by nature in Scotland. That vista of mountains and sea lochs was all very well, but what was that coming up behind you? A cloud of midges.<br><br> Pat Macgregor walked past just such caf�-hedonists on her way back to Scotland Street. She had crossed the town on foot earlier that day to have lunch with her father - her mother was still away, this time visiting another troublesome sister in Forfar - and her father had invited her for Saturday lunch in the Canny Man's on Morningside Road. This was a curious place, an Edinburgh institution, with its cluttered shelves of non-sequitur objects and its numerous pictures. And, like the trophies on the walls, the denizens of the place had more than passing historical or aesthetic interest about them. Here one might on a Saturday afternoon meet a well-known raconteur enjoying a glass of beer with an old friend, or, very occasionally, one might spot Ramsey Dunbarton, from the Braids, who many years ago had played the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers at the Church Hill Theatre (with such conspicuous success).<br><br> There was no such interest that day. A mousy-looking man in a blue suit sat silently in a corner with a woman companion; the silence that reigned between them being broken only by the occasional sigh by one or other of them. He looked steadfastly down at the menu of open sandwiches, as if defeated by the choice and by life; her gaze moved about - out of the window, at the small slice of sky between the Morningside Road tenements, at the barman polishing glasses, at the tiles on the floor.<br><br> As she waited for her father to arrive, Pat found herself wondering at the road which had brought them to this arid point - a lifetime of small talk, perhaps, that had simply run out of steam; or perhaps this is what came of being married. Surely not, she thought; her own parents were still able to look at one another and find at least something to say, although often there was a formality in their conversation that made her uncomfortable - as if they were talking a language, like court Japanese, that imposed heavily on them to be correct.<br><br> In Pat's company, her father seemed more comfortable. Leaning back in the bench seat at the Canny Man's while he perused the menu, his conversation took its usual course, moving, by easy association, from topic to topic.<br><br> "This is, of course, the Canny Man's," he observed. "You'll notice that the sign outside says something quite different. The Volunteer Arms. But everybody - or everybody in the know, that is - calls it the Canny Man's. And that pub down on the way to Slateford is called the Gravediggers, although the sign outside says Athletic Arms. These are verbal tests, you see. Designed to distinguish."<br><br> Pat looked at him blankly. Her father was intelligible, but not all the time.<br><br> "These tests are designed to exclude others from the discourse - just as the word discourse itself is designed to do. These words are intended to say to people: this is a group thing. If you don't understand what we're talking about, you're not a member of the group.<br><br> "So, if you call this place the Canny Man's it shows that you belong, that you know what's what in Edinburgh. And that, you know, is what everybody wants, underneath. We want to belong."<br><br> He laid the menu down on the table and looked at his daughter. "Do you know what the NB is?"<br><br> Pat shook her head and was about to reply that she did not; but he cut her short with a smile and a half-raised hand. "An unfair question," he said. "At least to somebody of your age. But anybody over forty would know that the NB is the North British Hotel, which is today called the Balmoral - that great pile down at the end of Princes Street. That was always the NB until they irritatingly started to call it the Balmoral. And if you really want to make a point - to tell somebody that you were here before they were - that it's your city - you can refer to it as the NB. Then at least some people won't know what you're talking about."<br><br> "But why would anybody want that?" she asked.<br><br> "Because we like our private references," he said. "And, as I've said, we want to feel that we belong. It's a simple matter of feelings of security . . ."<br><br> He smiled at his daughter. "Talking of the NB Hotel, there was a wonderful poet called Robert Garioch. He wrote poems about Edinburgh and about the city and its foibles. He wrote a poem about seeing people coming out of the NB Grill and getting into what he called a muckle great municipal Rolls-Royce. That said it all, you see. He said more about the city of his day in those few lines than many others would in fifty pages."<br><br> He paused. "But, my dear, you must be hungry. And you said that you have something to tell me. You said that you've made a momentous decision, and I'm going on about semiotics and the poetry of Robert Garioch. Is it a really important decision - really important?"<br><br> "It is," said Pat. "It really is. It's about my whole life, I think."<br><br> "You think?"<br><br> "Yes, I think so."<br><br> 2. Letting Go<br><br> When his daughter had announced that she had made an important decision - an announcement casually dropped into the telephone conversation they had had before their lunch at the Canny Man's in Morningside Road - Dr Macgregor had experienced a distressingly familiar pang of dread. Ever since Pat had chosen to spend her gap year in Australia, he had been haunted by the possibility that she would leave Scotland and simply not return. Australia was a world away, and it was full of possibilities. Anybody might be forgiven for going to Melbourne or Sydney - or even to Perth - and discovering that life in those places was fuller than the one they had led before. There was more space in Australia, and more light - but it was also true that there was there an exhilarating freedom, precisely the sort of freedom that might appeal to a nineteen-year-old. And there were young men, too, who must have been an additional lure. She might meet one of these and stay forever, forgetful of the fact that vigorous Australian males within a few years mutated into homo Australiensis suburbis, into drinkers of beer and into addicts of televised footie, butterflies, thus, into caterpillars.<br><br> So he had spent an anxious ten months wondering whether she would come back to Scotland and upbraiding himself constantly about the harbouring of such fears. He knew that it was wrong for parents to think this way, and had told many of his own patients that they should stop worrying about their offspring and let go. "You must be able to let go," he had said, on countless occasions. "Your children must be allowed to lead their own lives." And even as he uttered the words he realised the awful banality of what he said; but it was difficult, was it not, to talk about letting go without sounding like a passage from Kahlil Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i>, which had views on such matters. The trouble with<i> The Prophet</i> was that it all sounded so profound when you first encountered it, and yet it was the sort of thing that one grew out of - just as one grew out of Jack Kerouac. It was entirely appropriate to have <i>The Prophet</i> on one's shelves in one's early twenties, but not, he thought, in one's forties, or beyond. One must be prepared to let go of <i>The Prophet</i>.<br><br> And although he gave this advice to people, he found it difficult - almost impossible, in fact - to practise it himself. He and his wife, Maureen, had only one child; she was their future, not only in the genetic sense, but in an emotional one too. In the case of Dr Macgregor himself, this was particularly true. He enjoyed cordial relations with Maureen, but there was a distance between them which he realised could never be bridged. It had been apparent from the earliest years of the marriage that they really shared very few interests, and had little to talk about. Her energies were focused on public causes and on her own, largely dysfunctional family. She had two difficult sisters and one difficult brother, and these siblings had duly spawned difficult and demanding children. So while she nominally lived in Edinburgh, in reality she spent a great deal of her time moving from relative to relative, coping with whatever crisis had freshly emerged. The sister in Angus - the one who drank - was particularly demanding. This manipulative sister really wanted Maureen to live with her, and to this end she longed for Maureen's widowhood, and said as much, which was tactless. There are many women whose lives would be immeasurably improved by widowhood, but one should not always point that out.<br><br> The absenteeism of his wife had its natural consequence. Pat became for him the focus of his family feeling; she was his best friend, and, to the extent that the father and daughter relationship permitted, his confidante. Of course he knew of the dangers of this; that the investing of one's entire world in a child was to give a powerful hostage to fortune, and that he should develop other friendships and ties. But he had somehow failed to do that. He was popular with his professional colleagues and he would have called many of these his friends, but there were limits to such friendships. People moved jobs; they went away; they developed new, outside friendships which were more absorbing than those of work. He should join a club, perhaps; but what clubs could he possibly take seriously? He had never had much interest in golf, and he was not sure whether he would approve of the ethos of a golf club, and what other clubs did people have in mind when they recommended membership as an antidote to loneliness? Perhaps they meant the Scottish Arts Club; he had walked past it one day and seen people having lunch in the dining room on the ground floor. He had stopped in his tracks and gazed in at the sight. A well-known journalist was holding court, it seemed, to an audience of antique dealers - he knew one of them, a man with an exemplary moustache - and portrait painters. They had full glasses of red wine before them and he saw, but could not hear, their laughter. For a moment he had been transfixed by this vision of fellowship and had thought: this is what I do not have. But although this sight had made him think that he might perhaps apply to join, he had done nothing about it, and he had gone back to his empty house that day (Pat had been in Australia and Maureen in Kelso, at her difficult brother's house), and he had sat and reflected on loneliness and on how few, how very few, are the human bonds that lie between us and the state of being completely alone. How many such bonds did the average person have? Five? Ten? In his case, he thought, it seemed as if the answer was two.<br><br> So it was natural that he should feel trepidation about any decision that Pat should make, because that decision could always be to go back to Australia. That was what he dreaded above all else, because he knew that if she did that, he would lose her. He wanted her to stay in Edinburgh, or go to Glasgow at the most. Her choice of St Andrews University was perfect in his mind; that was just up the road and completely unthreatening.<br><br> Now, in the cluttered surroundings of the Canny Man's, he steeled himself for impending loss. "You said that you'd made a major decision?"<br><br> Pat looked at her father. "Yes. I've decided not to go to St Andrews after all."<br><br> He caught his breath. She was returning to Australia. How few were the words needed to end a world.<br><br> 3. Narcissism and Social Progress<br><br> Pat saw nothing in her father's face of the hollow dread he felt. He was accomplished at concealing his feelings, of course, as all psychiatrists must be. He had heard such a range of human confessions that very little would cause him so much as to raise an eyebrow or to betray, with so much as a transitory frown, disapproval over what people did, or thought, or perhaps thought about doing. And even now, as he sat like a convicted man awaiting his sentence, he showed nothing of his emotion.<br><br> "Yes," said Pat. "I've written to St Andrews and told them that I don't want the place next month. They've said that's fine."<br><br> "Fine," echoed Dr Macgregor faintly. But how could it be fine? How could she turn down the offer from that marvellous place, with all that fun and all that student nonsense, and Raisin Week and Kate Kennedy and all those things? To turn that down before one had even sampled it was surely to turn your back on happiness.<br><br> "I've decided to go to Edinburgh University instead," went on Pat. "I've been in touch with the people in George Square and they say I can transfer my St Andrews place to them. So that's what I'm going to do. Philosophy and English."<br><br> For a moment Dr Macgregor said nothing. He looked down at his shoes and saw, as if for the first time, the pattern of the brogue. And then he looked up and glanced at his daughter, who was watching him, as if waiting for his reaction.<br><br> "You're not cross with me, are you?" said Pat. "I know I've messed you around with the two gap years and now this change of plans. You aren't cross with me?"<br><br> He reached out and placed his hand briefly on hers, and then moved his hand back.<br><br> "Cross is the last thing I am," he said, and then burst out laughing. "Does that sound odd to you? Rather like the word order of a German or Yiddish speaker speaking English? They say things like, 'Happy I'm not,' don't they? Remember the Katzenjammer Kids?"</p><h2>Lighting the Eye of the Dragon: Inner Secrets of Taoist Feng Shui</h2><p>A feng shui practitioner discusses his technique in this special guide to decorating, sharing long-kept secrets of the Taoist tradition regarding energy flow.

Brassa�'s curiosity about his subjects and the originality of his approach highlight the depth of his identification with Paris, his adopted city. The son of a professor of French literature, Brassa� had first visited the city at the age of 5; later, in the early 1920s, he returned to make it his home after completion of studies in fine art in Budapest and Berlin. Settling in the bohemian arrondissement of Montparnasse, mixing with artists and writers, Brassa� took up photography "in order to capture the beauty of streets and gardens in the rain and fog, and to capture Paris by night." He lures us into the smoky, highly charged world of clubs and caf�s, where nicotine-stained lovers in cheap clothes become impossibly desirable through the camera's lens. Streets, stairways, and canals are moodily lit; even a man rummaging for food in a rubbish bin takes on a cinematic aura. Yet Brassa�'s photographs contain a strange mixture of seediness and resilience that ultimately triumphs over any false notions of glamour. He depicts scenes of poverty and its trappings--alcoholism, prostitution, violence, hunger. The chaotic social whirl of 1930s Paris dies down to the quiet suffering of a city under occupation, with its two great literary lights, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, sitting out the war, stony-faced in the Caf� de Flore. Accompanied by extracts from Brassa�'s own writings, contemporaries such as Henry Miller, and essays from other contributors, and containing 308 images, <i>Brassa�</i> is a fine testament to an artist whose images of one city have proved so enduring. <i>--Catherine Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>Robert Grenier&#39;s previous books include A Box of Photographs and Brassa�: The Monograph.</p><h2>A Very British Coup: The novel that foretold the rise of Corbyn</h2><p>Ex-steel worker Harry Perkins has led the Labour Party to a stunning victory, pledging to remove American bases, take public control of finance, and dismantle the press monopolies.

Other chapters deal with crew training and specific tactical aspects to employ such a heavy tank under all fighting conditions. Further aspects are covered, such as the protection level of the Tiger and reasons for losses - as well as propaganda work with this famous beast. Due to the usage of more than 1,200 photos and drawings, even complex crew tasks and procedures are illustrated in a way that non-Tiger crewmen will be able to comprehend.</p><p>Wolfgang Schneider served 41 years in the German Army and retired in 2010.

A genuine Western Buddhism is now taking birth</em>, writes Joseph Goldstein, one of America's most respected Buddhist teachers. The birth pangs include controversy and conflict -- and fear that genuine teachings may vanish as traditions converge in the melting pot of American practice. But Goldstein recognizes a possibility, indeed a at potential, for the essence of Buddhism to survive on Western soil, in Western minds.</p><p>His visionary synthesis points a way for Buddhism to grow and flower while remaining rooted in the teachings of the great Asian schools -- from India and Burma to Tibet and Japan. Marked by a simplicity derived from the Buddha's own pragmatic response to life, Goldstein distills the essential question that is at the base of all the traditions: What works to free the mind from suffering?</p><p>He provides a brief historical overview of early Buddhism and explores the mind-changing reflections that bring us to the Dharma path -- the teachings of liberation, free from sectarian attachments. Upon this foundation Goldstein then shows how the great masters from all traditions have pointed to the essence of ultimate freedom. This is the best kind of Dharma book: one that is based on personal experience rather than on theory, accessible to newcomers and seasoned practitioners alike, and rich in practical ways to cultivate the qualities of an awakened mind and heart.</p><p>In <em>One Dharma</em> one of America's foremost Buddhist teachers presents the central teachings and practices of the emerging Western Buddhism in clear, personal language. In <em>One Dharma</em> we discover the essential points common to all Buddhist teachings.</p></p><p>Insight Meditation cofounder Joseph Goldstein ponders the possibility that all Buddhist teachings could be distilled into <i>One Dharma</i>. As Buddhism continues to grow in the West, Goldstein shows us the value of uniting this movement rather than allowing it to become fractured by its subtle differences. He does not advocate a watering down or mixing up of the various traditions. Rather, "We can practice each of them in its own integrity and come to a genuine depth of understanding." Readers who are wary of a scholarly analysis of Buddhist nuances need not worry. Goldstein (<i>The Experience of Insight</i>) relies on personal anecdotes and accessible language to explore the common themes in all Buddhist teachings. Though purists will no doubt quibble, Goldstein believes that following one Dharma is the way the West will be won, weaving together the methods of mindfulness, the motivation of compassion, and the liberating wisdom of nonclinging. "These three pillars--mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom--are not Indian or Burmese, Japanese or Tibetan; they are qualities in our own minds." <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Joseph Goldstein is a cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, where he is one of the resident guiding teachers. He is the author of <em>The Experience of Insight</em> and <em>Insight Meditation</em> and has coauthored books with both Sharon Salzberg and Jack Kornfield. He has studied and practiced meditation since 1967 under the guidance of eminent teachers from India, Burma, and Tibet. He lectures and leads retreats around the world.</p></p><h2>Edward VIII</h2><p>EDWARD VIII was heralded as the definitive biography of the ex-King and awarded the prestigious Wolfson Prize when it was first published in 1974.

This is the most comprehensive course on yoga and meditation available today, giving you a profound and intimate understanding of how to apply these age-old teachings, on a practical, as well as spiritual, day-to-day level in this modern age. Over 450 pages of text and photos give you a complete and detailed presentation of hatha yoga (yoga postures), yoga philosophy, affirmations, meditation instruction, and breathing techniques. Also included are suggestions for daily yoga routines, helpful information on diet, and alternative healing techniques. Apply these teachings and techniques in your daily life and you will attain your highest soul potential: true happiness, inner peace, and the dynamic joy of your soul. Included with this book are web links to free Raja Yoga course downloads containing a guided yoga postures session, a guided meditation, and an inspiring talk by Swami Kriyananda on the art of meditation, titled, Meditation: The Great Problem Solver.</p><p>J. Donald Walters (Swami Kriyananda) is an internationally known author, lecturer, and composer. Widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on meditation and yoga, he has taught these principles and techniques to hundreds of thousands of students around the world. <p>An advocate of simple living and high thinking, his more than 80 books emphasize the need to live wisely by one&#x2019;s own experience of life, and not by abstract theories or dogmas. </p><p>In 1968, Walters founded Ananda Village in Nevada City, California, dedicated to spreading the spirit of friendship, service, and community throughout the world. Ananda is recognized as one of the most successful intentional community in the world. Today, over 1,000 people reside in five Ananda communities throughout the U.S. (Seattle, Palo Alto, Portland, Sacramento and Ananda Village) and in Europe. The European retreat and community located in Assisi, Italy, also serves Ananda meditation groups in Europe, Croatia, and Russia. Both the Nevada City and Assisi communities have world-renowned guest retreat facilities where thousands of visitors annually visit for renewal or instruction in many aspects of meditation, yoga, and the spiritual life. Walters has also established "Living Wisdom" schools for grades K-12 in Nevada City, Sacramento, Portland, and Palo Alto. </p><p>Mr. Walters books and music have sold over 3 million copies worldwide and been translated into 28 languages. He is the author of more than 80 books on a variety of topics including leadership, education, creativity, and moral values. His Best-selling titles include Awaken to Superconsciousness, Meditation for Starters, God Is for Everyone,The Art of Supportive Leadership, The Path &#x2013; One Man&#x2019;s Quest on the Only Path There Is, Money Magnetism, The Essence of Self-Realization, Affirmations for Self-Healing, Education for Life, and his best-selling Secrets gift books. </p><p>A composer since 1964, Walters has written over 400 musical works. His music is inspiring, soothing, and uplifting. Many of his new albums are instrumental works with brief affirmations or visualizations. Chuck Dilberto, of Awareness Magazine says, "Walters&#x2019; words and music are full of his life and light. His sole intention is to heal, something we could all use during these chaotic times". His recent albums include Secrets of Love, Music to Awaken Superconsciousness, Windows on the World and Surrender: Mystical Music for Yoga. As a composer, Walters is best known for the top-selling albums Mystic Harp and Mystic Harp 2, featuring the legendary harpist Derek Bell, of the 5-time Grammy Award-winning group The Chieftains.</p>With yoga much in vogue these days, the prolific Walters, a longtime teacher and disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda and founder of Ananda Village, offers an ambitious package of instruction in the discipline. Intended as a 14-week home-study course, the book's 14 chapters cover teachings, postures and routines, meditation and breathing techniques, health and healing topics and diet. It's tough to do a good yoga book, because a number of variables have to converge: substantive integrity, clarity in how-to explanations and quality visuals. By those measures, this book succeeds. Walters's long teaching record shows in his ability to discuss key yogic concepts and practices in simple terms. Though the author is not a particularly gifted writer, the how-to part instruction in postures is adequately clear. Workmanlike b&amp;w photos illustrate form, and each explanation includes a helpful statement of the benefits of each pose. This comprehensive guide has an extra medium to distinguish it on the crowded yoga bookshelf: an accompanying audio CD that contains a vague lecture as well as more helpful sections of guided meditation and posture instruction. The book has its fuzzy edges: relating the Bible to yoga teachings is fancifully unnecessary, and recipes are not its long suit. All things considered, however, it's superior to books that reduce yoga to a series of physical exercises taught by this year's guru.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Identifying American architecture: A pictorial guide to styles and terms, 1600-1945</h2><p><p><strong>What styles of architecture are found in your neighborhood--Georgian, Prairie, International, Spanish, Colonial Revival?<br></strong></p>This book enables the reader to determine styles and identify architectural terms by comparing real buildings with the book's many photographs.<br> 214 photographs</p><p></p><h2>America&#39;s Secret Army : The Untold Story of the Counter Intelligence Corps</h2><p>Describes the activities of the Army&#39;s spycatching unit from the early days of World War II to the Cold War era, when it was merged with the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps.</p><p></p><h2>Slim Aarons: Great Escapes (Hardcover Journal: Bright Pink)</h2><p><p>This deluxe hardcover journal features photographs of magnificent holiday spots of the 1950s, &#x2019;60s, and &#x2019;70s.

Through the stories of American diplomats, the book explains how their work affects millions of people in the United States and around the world every day, and how it contributes to U.S. security and prosperity. It shows a more inclusive American diplomacy that has moved beyond interacting with governments and has engaged with the private sector, civil society and individual citizens. Having visited 77 embassies and consulates, and interviewed more than 600 American diplomats, the author reveals a Foreign Service whose diversity and professional versatility have shattered old perceptions and redefined modern diplomacy. But he also depicts a service not fully equipped to address the complex challenges of the 21st century.

Albright, former secretary of state</b><br><br>"Nicholas Kralev's excellent account of the U.S. Foreign Service at the beginning of this new century makes vivid the continuing relevance and struggle of diplomacy to keep pace with a rapidly changing international landscape.

But near the small town of Bearkill a stubborn forest fire now rages out of control, and as embers swirl dangerously in the smoke-filled air, a teenage girl with a history of running away has dropped out of sight again. The locals and the law both think Tara Wylie is up to her old tricks&#x2014;until her mother receives a terrifying text message.<br> &nbsp;<br> Equally disturbing: Henry Gemerle&#x2014;a kidnapper and rapist who once held three girls prisoner for fifteen years&#x2014;has escaped, and may be lurking in Bearkill. As the fire closes in, Lizzie teams up with her boss, Sheriff Cody Chevrier, and state cop Dylan Hudson to search for the missing girl and the wily fugitive. But they&#x2019;re blocked by Tara&#x2019;s mother, a frustrating teller of needless lies and keeper of dark, incomprehensible secrets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following a trail of grisly clues&#x2014;a bloodstained motel room, a makeshift coffin in a shallow grave&#x2014;Lizzie is drawn ever closer to the flames in her race to save an innocent and corner a monster. Someone else also wants to find Tara Wylie and Henry Gemerle, though, for reasons that have nothing to do with mercy or justice. And when they all meet, the inferno threatening Bearkill will pale in comparison to the hell that&#x2019;s about to break loose.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Girls She Left Behind</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[Sarah] Graves writes at full strength when she&#x2019;s focused on this economically depressed region, once the hub of a thriving lumber industry but now mostly the domain of meth cooks, unhappy teenagers and scores of volunteer firefighters battling tenacious blazes in the surrounding forest. . . .

Splattering against the big plate-�glass front window of Aroostook County sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Lizzie Snow&#x2019;s storefront office, the wet ice bits made a sound like tiny fists weakly hammering to get in.<br><br>Just another fine evening in Bearkill, Maine, Lizzie thought glumly, peering through the streaming glass as Dylan Hudson&#x2019;s familiar figure came striding into view. Galoshes splashing in the slush, the tall plainclothes detective&#x2019;s shoulders hunched sharply under his topcoat and black-�and-�white-�striped scarf, ice-�melt trickling in a shining stream off the brim of his hat.<br><br>At the sight of him she let the familiar lurch of feeling go through her, then set it firmly aside. Emotions were one thing but actions were entirely another, she told herself sternly.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d; He swung in, shedding showers of icy droplets as he crossed the sparsely furnished office. Except for the half dozen wanted posters on the bulletin board and the police scanner on a shelf, the white-�painted walls and gray industrial carpet made the place look like an insurance agency&#x2019;s not-�very-�successful branch office.<br><br>Dylan deposited the large white paper shopping bag he carried on her desk. Delicious aromas floated from the bag.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, yourself.&#x201d; She should not have let him come, but the miserable night made his driving the ninety miles back to Bangor unwise even for a Maine state cop, and his promise of Thai food delivered to her office had sealed the deal.<br><br>&#x201c;So, anything shakin&#x2019;?&#x201d; He pulled out the familiar white cardboard cartons, pushing aside the flotsam on her desk to make two places amid the clutter.<br><br>&#x201c;Couple things.&#x201d; Last from the bag were a pair of Tsingtaos, the cold brown bottles dripping condensation, and a bottle opener.<br><br>&#x201c;Fire crews&#x2019;re still out,&#x201d; she added with a glance at the scanner on the shelf above her desk. &#x201c;But wrapping it up.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite the wintry mix pelting outside now, northern Maine was in the grip of a serious long-�term dry spell; a rash of brush fires around Bearkill had made chatter on the police band lively all day. But since the sky had opened up late this afternoon the radio spat only routine local dispatches.<br><br>The cash register slip in the shopping bag said the food had come from Bangor. &#x201c;Dylan, how&#x2019;d you keep this stuff hot? And the beer so&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Well, but it was no problem keeping things cold in this kind of weather, was it? On a night like tonight, back in Boston that cop scanner would be hopping with more minor vehicle mishaps than you could shake a tow truck at.<br><br>Here in Bearkill, if you slid into a ditch most likely your neighbor pulled you out. &#x201c;Microwave,&#x201d; Dylan explained.<br><br>He gestured toward the combination convenience store and gas station down the block. It and a dozen other small businesses made up the bulk of downtown Bearkill&#x2019;s commercial activity.<br><br>If you could call it activity. Situated in the very rooftop of Maine at the edge of the Great North Woods, Bearkill had once been the thriving center of a booming lumber industry. But the boom had gone bust, and now drab storefront tenants like the Cut-�n-�Run hair salon, the Paper Chase office and party supply store (balloon bouquets our specialty!), a tae kwon do studio, and the New to You used-�clothing exchange dominated what remained.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a few pretty beat-�looking forest service guys and gals in that convenience store right now,&#x201d; Dylan added, sounding sympathetic.<br><br>The combination gas station and snack vendor was called&#x2014;�really, a less appetizing name could not have been found, Lizzie thought&#x2014;�the Go-�Mart. &#x201c;What I heard, they&#x2019;ve been out trenching in the fields and forests for nearly twenty-�four hours,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>By this time in a normal year, the fire danger in the area would be long over. But it had not been a normal year.<br><br>Dylan shook his head ruefully. &#x201c;Digging firebreaks, that&#x2019;s no-�kidding hard labor. Remind me of that the next time you hear me bitching about my job, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um. Yeah.&#x201d; On the shelf with the scanner was a framed commendation from the Boston PD, where until two months earlier Lizzie had been a member of the elite Homicide/Violent Crimes Investigation Unit. Beside those items, a Lucite stand held a snapshot of a little blond girl.<br><br>The little blond girl was the reason that Lizzie was no longer in Boston, and no longer a homicide cop. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re catching a break now, though,&#x201d; she added, waving out at the sleet.<br><br>She debated telling Dylan about the other thing she&#x2019;d been working today. If she did, she&#x2019;d have a much harder time getting rid of him after dinner.<br><br>On the other hand, a second opinion might not be such a bad idea. &#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;ve got a local teenager gone missing.&#x201d;<br><br>Just weeks earlier she&#x2019;d been hired to be the eyes and ears of the Aroostook County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department here in Bearkill. And why an ex&#x2013;�Boston homicide cop had turned out to be exactly the right person for the job was a whole other story.<br><br>But it was not the one preoccupying her now. &#x201c;Fourteen-�year-�old&#x2014;�you know the type, she thinks she&#x2019;s twenty.&#x201d;<br><br>Northern Maine, with thousands of square miles of forests, mountains, and farm fields sparsely dotted by tiny, struggling towns much like Bearkill, was so different from Boston that it might as well have been on some other planet. But teenagers were the same just about everywhere, she was coming to realize.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hitting a wall on it,&#x201d; she admitted.<br><br>Dylan was a murder cop, too. So he knew all about missing girls; the found ones, and the ones who never got found.<br><br>Especially them.<br><br>Lean and sharp-�featured, with pale skin, dark, hooded eyes, and dark, wavy hair that she happened to know curled into tight, Botticelli-�angel-�type ringlets when he was in the shower . . . <br><br>Stop that, she told herself firmly. Stop it this minute.<br><br>He popped the tops off both beer bottles. &#x201c;Yeah, well, why don&#x2019;t you fill me in on the case while you eat. Dig in.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t have to be invited twice. One of the first things a cop learned as a rookie was to eat whatever, whenever; regular mealtimes were for civilians.<br><br>&#x201c;Any reason you think she isn&#x2019;t just a runaway?&#x201d; he asked, shoveling shrimp in red curry onto hot noodles.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, there is. Couple of them, actually.&#x201d; She chewed, swallowed, drank beer. A stickler for the rules would&#x2019;ve said no drinking, her being on the job and all. But then a stickler probably wouldn&#x2019;t have been stuck in a sleet storm way out here at the ass end of the earth.<br><br>Hell, if she&#x2019;d been a fourteen-�year-�old girl in this nowhere little berg, she&#x2019;d have probably done a runner herself.<br><br>At the same time another thought niggled persistently at her, something she was forgetting. But it remained elusive.<br><br>&#x201c;Tara&#x2019;s taken off several times before and she&#x2019;s always come back,&#x201d; Lizzie said. &#x201c;Everyone goes nuts looking for her for a few days, then she waltzes in like nothing happened. Even though her mother&#x2019;s frantic, she thinks that&#x2019;s probably how it&#x2019;ll all end up this time, too. But . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She let her voice trail off, trying to put into words what a bad hit she got off the situation. Some things looked worrisome at first but ended up fine; others stank from the get-�go.<br><br>Like this thing now. Dylan eyed the dark front window, still hissing with sleet. &#x201c;Yeah. But,&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;How long?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s seen her since yesterday morning. It was a school holiday,&#x201d; Lizzie replied reluctantly.<br><br>It was now Tuesday night. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s never skipped a whole day of school before,&#x201d; Lizzie added.<br><br>Dylan&#x2019;s eyebrows went up and down once in reply. Bad sign, they signaled.<br><br>But she knew that, too. &#x201c;I mean, I guess she could be just a runaway. Which is what most everyone around here is assuming.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone but me. A shred of broccoli clung distractingly to his lower lip.<br><br>&#x201c;And like I say, the girl&#x2019;s done it before. Maybe decided to push it a little further this time. But the other difference is that the earlier times she&#x2019;s always phoned home to let her mom know she&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br><br>Lizzie ate a shrimp. &#x201c;Not right away, maybe, but she&#x2019;s always done it. This time, though, not a peep. And none of her friends knows where she is, either.&#x201d;<br><br>The friends had been the usual gaggle of teen girls, diffuse and dreamy with the occasional speculative glance at Lizzie&#x2019;s weapon. Overall it had been like talking to a basket of kittens.<br><br>&#x201c;You believe them?&#x201d; asked Dylan. &#x201c;And is there a boyfriend?&#x201d;<br><br>Standard questions. The broccoli shred was gone. &#x201c;Yeah, and he&#x2019;s missing, too, along with his motorcycle. So duh, right?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy was an eighteen-�year-�old local kid with nothing on his record but a couple of misdemeanors; one was a pot bust but even that was only for possession, and the rest were just for underage drinking. So no real red flags had gone up from Aaron DeWilde, who was no Boy Scout but merely the kind of sullen, doe-�eyed misfit that girls like Tara had been finding the sensitive side of since time began.<br><br>&#x201c;No Amber Alert,&#x201d; added Lizzie. Tara Wylie had already been the subject of two of these; each time the girl had showed up on her own, demanding to know what all the fuss was about.<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet, anyway. Mom&#x2019;s put up a few homemade posters in case someone around here saw something but that&#x2019;s all. Hey, not my decision,&#x201d; she added at his look of surprise. &#x201c;Maybe if I knew the girl better, I&#x2019;d feel better about that, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cell phone?&#x201d; Dylan scraped a slice of mushroom from one of the cartons and ate it.<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got one, but it&#x2019;s a hand-�me-�down, just a cheap little burner.&#x201d; No GPS tracking software in it. &#x201c;And either it&#x2019;s turned off or the battery&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, the sleet stopped suddenly as if a switch had been thrown. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Lizzie said.<br><br>Since her arrival here in Bearkill, the weather had featured a single blizzard that met all her expectations for a take-�no-�prisoners northern Maine winter event. But the snow had melted swiftly, leaving the rural terrain looking oddly like the &#x201c;after&#x201d; pictures on a global-�warming-�alert website: cracked soil, spring-�fed ponds dried to muck-�holes, withered winter wheat.<br><br>Tonight&#x2019;s sleet, in fact, was only the second measurable precipitation since Labor Day, all moisture instantly inhaled by the fiery breath of a summer that, but for the one brief wintry interlude, just wouldn&#x2019;t quit. And the weather now, while impressive to look at, was giving little relief to the desperately parched earth.<br><br>&#x201c;All the fire teams&#x2019;ll be right back out there tomorrow,&#x201d; predicted Dylan, eyeing the streaming front window skeptically.<br><br>Chewing, she nodded agreement. The danger had been critical for weeks, everyone in the county on high alert for the smell of smoke; in the grand scheme of things tonight meant nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that sticking out of your shirt?&#x201d; A corner of some thinly woven silvery material peeked from above his loosened tie.<br><br>Dylan rolled his eyes. &#x201c;New vest. Testing it out for a little while. I guess the brass in Augusta decided I wasn&#x2019;t bulletproof enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I don&#x2019;t blame them. You must be killing them in workers&#x2019; comp alone, not to mention their safety stats.&#x201d;<br><br>She touched her napkin to her lips, then wadded it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been nailed three times, right? Or four? It&#x2019;s a wonder you don&#x2019;t have lead poisoning by now.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded, grimacing. Dylan liked to pretend it was no big deal, getting shot. But she noticed he wasn&#x2019;t complaining about the new vest.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been comfy enough so far. Not heavy or bulky, and they tell me it&#x2019;s chock-�full of bullet-�stopping space-�age polymers,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For what that&#x2019;s worth.&#x201d; Then:<br><br>&#x201c;Little bird called me today,&#x201d; he remarked.<br><br>She swallowed. So that&#x2019;s why he was here. &#x201c;About . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>But she knew. Nicki. She looked up again at the blond child in the framed photo. Nine years old, eight years missing . . . <br><br>If she was still alive she was Lizzie&#x2019;s only surviving kin, the daughter of Lizzie&#x2019;s murdered sister, Cecily, whose body had been found nearly a decade earlier on the Maine coast.<br><br>Oh, Sissy, I&#x2019;m so sorry . . . After Sissy&#x2019;s death there&#x2019;d been a murder investigation with all the right bells and whistles. But no culprit, or any possible motives, had ever been found, and her baby wasn&#x2019;t found, either. And now there were rumors that a little girl very like what Nicki would&#x2019;ve grown up into had been spotted here in Aroostook County.<br><br>More than rumors, actually. It was why Lizzie was here. She looked away from the photo.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Dylan. &#x201c;Guy I talked to says it might be Nicki, anyway. But don&#x2019;t get your hopes up,&#x201d; he added unnecessarily.<br><br>The food was gone. She gathered the cartons and napkins and the plastic cutlery together to stuff into the trash. Later she would haul the bag to the dumpster behind the building. It was a far cry from what she&#x2019;d gotten used to in the Boston PD where, to a decorated homicide cop like herself, handling the trash meant snapping a set of cuffs onto it.<br><br>In Bearkill, in fact, everything was a far cry from Boston. But she&#x2019;d been here only a few weeks, she reminded herself. She couldn&#x2019;t very well give up on looking for Nicki when she&#x2019;d barely settled in.<br><br>&#x201c;So what else did your guy say?&#x201d; she asked when Dylan came back from rinsing the beer bottles in the washroom.<br><br>Recycling bottles and cans was huge around here, not so much for the environment as for the nickels, northern Maine not being a high-�income territory unless you were a lumber company manager or farm-�equipment distributor.<br><br>Or a methamphetamine cook. Just in the time she&#x2019;d been here the MDEA had busted a trio of operations, small teams making the lethally attractive drug in mobile homes or at remote, unlikely-�to-�be-�stumbled-�upon campsites.<br><br>&#x201c;Says he saw a kid.&#x201d; Dylan put a hand companionably on her arm as he passed, let it rest there for a more-�than-�companionable moment. &#x201c;With a couple. Transient. Living out of a car, he said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, great.&#x201d; From what she could tell so far, poverty in Maine boiled down, as it had anywhere she&#x2019;d ever been, to people just doing what they could to keep a roof over their heads. Like those meth cooks, even; it was a filthy, dangerous, and basically depraved way to make a living, but there weren&#x2019;t many jobs around here and people had expenses to cover.</p><h2>24 Piano Transcriptions of Classical Masterpieces: From Orchestral, Operatic, Vocal, &amp; Chamber Works (Alfred's Classic Editions)</h2><p>Robert Schultz has transcribed this wonderful collection of the most famous orchestral, operatic, vocal, and chamber works for advanced piano.

He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.A challenge to undertake a dangerous climb in the Himalayas in Nepal might help Tim Overleigh salvage his life or lose it in Malfi's harrowing tale of six men following one man's obsession on a nearly impossible quest. Andrew Trumbauer, a rich, eccentric, charismatic daredevil, assembles and outfits the group of men, each chosen by him for a particular reason. Overleigh, once a noted sculptor, descended into alcoholism after his wife, Hannah, left him and was later killed in a car accident. The men's route leads from the Valley of Walls to the Sanctuary of the Gods and the Hall of Mirrors before reaching the never before crossed Canyon of Souls. Intense descriptions of the rigors of the climb alternate with Overleigh's backstory and his growing realization that Trumbauer has more than one agenda. Malfi (Shamrock Alley) delivers a nearly straightforward adventure story of man against the elements with man being the most dangerous element of all. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Despite its dazzling reputation, Isaac Newton&#39;s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, or simply the Principia, remains a mystery for many people. Few of even the most intellectually curious readers, including professional scientists and mathematicians, have actually looked in the Principia or appreciate its contents. Mathematician Pask seeks to remedy this deficit in this accessible guided tour through Newton&#39;s masterpiece. Using the final edition of the Principia, Pask clearly demonstrates how it sets out Newton&#39;s (and now our) approach to science; how the framework of classical mechanics is established; how terrestrial phenomena like the tides and projectile motion are explained; and how we can understand the dynamics of the solar system and the paths of comets. He also includes scene-setting chapters about Newton himself and scientific developments in his time, as well as chapters about the reception and influence of the Principia up to the present day.</p><p><b>Colin Pask</b> (Canberra, Australia) is the author of <i>Math for the Frightened: Facing Scary Symbols and Everything Else That Freaks You Out about Mathematics</i>. He is an emeritus professor of mathematics and a visiting fellow and professor in the School of Physical, Environmental and Mathematical Sciences at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia.Preface to the Paperback Edition:<br><br>The ancient fascination with the heavens is as strong as ever today as advances in science and engineering create new methods for&nbsp; space exploration. We now routinely use satellites in such things&nbsp; as GPS navigational systems and orbiting telescopes give us results with remarkable resolution. We plan trajectories to visit Mars, search for a ninth planet in the outer reaches of our solar system,&nbsp; and space tourism is about to become a reality. The detection of gravitational waves tells us about&nbsp; the very far reaches of the universe while exoplanets have been located orbiting the stars nearest to Earth.&nbsp;<br><br>The tools we use to examine those possibilities and plan our exploration of space were first developed by Isaac Newton in his <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> (the <i>Principia</i>).&nbsp;However, even more than that, Newton introduces and shows how to use the scientific way of thinking that underpins so much in our modern way of life. The <i>Principia</i> is the first comprehensive book on science as we know it today. It remains as relevant today as it was three hundred years ago, for as Einstein put it, Newton&#x2019;s &#x201c;clear and wide ideas will forever retain their significance as the foundation on which our modern conceptions of physics&nbsp; have been built.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>As an example of that Newton suggested that we can understand the properties of matter on the large or macroscopic scale in terms of the interactions of its microscopic or atomic constituents. His demonstration of this approach for gases and liquids anticipated a vast amount of modern science.&nbsp;<br><br>The <i>Principia</i> is indeed one of the "Great Books&#x201d;. It is one of the treasures of our civilization ranking alongside Homer&#x2019;s <i>Odyssey</i>, Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Macbeth</i> and Dicken&#x2019;s <i>Great Expectations</i>. Sadly, despite its supreme importance, in comparison the <i>Principia</i> tends to be ignored. The book you now hold aims to change all that. It&nbsp; provides a step-by-step guide to the <i>Principia</i>, its background, contents&nbsp; and implications. You too can appreciate this unrivalled breakthrough moment on the road to our modern world.&nbsp;<br><br>I am delighted that this new edition of <i>Magnificent Principia</i> will allow even more people to explore Newton&#x2019;s masterpiece and learn about the origins of modern science.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Colin Pask<br> December 2018</p><h2>A History of Britain at the Edge of the World? - 3000 Bc-Ad 1603</h2><p>History clings tight but it also kicks loose,&#39; writes Simon Schama at the outset of At the Edge of the World?, the first book in his three-volume journey into Britain&#39;s past. And change - sometimes gentle and subtle, sometimes shocking and violent - is the dynamic of Schama&#39;s unapologetically personal and grippingly written history. At its heart lie questions of compelling importance for Britain&#39;s future as well as its past: what makes or breaks a nation? To whom do we give our allegiance and why? And where do the boundaries of our community lie - in our hearth and home, our village or city, tribe or faith? What is Britain - one country or many? Has British history unfolded &#39;at the edge of the world&#39; or right at the heart of it? Schama delivers these themes in a form that is at once traditional and excitingly fresh. The great and the wicked are here - Becket and Thomas Cromwell, Robert the Bruce and Anne Boleyn - but so are countless more ordinary lives, depicted in Schama&#39;s brilliant portrait of the life of the British people.</p><p>&#x201c;Schama is an eloquent story-teller, a powerful saga-writer, a great communicator.

It is a historical fiction about the rise of Thomas Cromwell in King Henry VIII&#39;s court. The book is Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009. Translated by Ha Yun Sug. Volume 1 of 2 In Korean. Distributed by Tsai Fong Books, Inc.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy of <em>Wolf Hall</em> along. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em><p><strong>HILARY MANTEL</strong> is the author of thirteen books, including <em>A Place of Greater Safety, Beyond Black</em> and the memoir <em>Giving Up the Ghost</em>.

Still feeling hurt from an unkind remark Leo made at last year&#x2019;s party, Amanda spends her eleventh birthday without her now-estranged friend to share the fun. In the days that follow, both Amanda and Leo discover that they are caught in a time loop, waking up each morning to find themselves repeating their eleventh birthdays. They soon renew their friendship and&nbsp;begin to experiment by making different choices throughout the day, partly for the thrill of acting without long-term consequences and partly from their fear of never escaping this mysterious time trap. From the double-entendre title to the solid character portrayals to the clarity and wit of the writing, this novel offers a fresh twist on the familiar themes of middle-grade family and school dynamics. The mysterious power that rewinds time eventually seems less important than the power that Amanda finds within herself. Emboldened by the idea of daily do-overs, she discovers that&nbsp;small changes in her attitude and actions&nbsp;result in sometimes-subtle, sometimes-monumental shifts in results for herself, her family, and her friends. A rewarding choice for readers and a natural for booktalks and discussion groups.

Should the Confederate flag be allowed to fly over the South Carolina state capitol? Is it possible for America to honor General Custer <i>and</i> the Sioux Nation, Jefferson Davis <i>and</i> Abraham Lincoln? Indeed, can a liberal, multicultural society memorialize anyone at all, or is it committed to a strict neutrality about the quality of the lives led by its citizens?<p></p><p>In <i>Written in Stone</i>, legal scholar Sanford Levinson considers the tangled responses of ever-changing societies to the monuments and commemorations created by past regimes or outmoded cultural and political systems. Drawing on examples from Albania to Zimbabwe, from Moscow to Managua, and paying particular attention to examples throughout the American South, Levinson looks at social and legal arguments regarding the display, construction, modification, and destruction of public monuments. He asks what kinds of claims the past has on the present, particularly if the present is defined in dramatic opposition to its past values. In addition, he addresses the possibilities for responding to the use and abuse of public spaces and explores how a culture might memorialize its historical figures and events in ways that are beneficial to all its members.</p><p><i>Written in Stone</i> is a meditation on how national cultures have been or may yet be defined through the deployment of public monuments.

The Saturday Review wrote that she had &#39;assembled as many detestable people as it is possible to pack between the covers of a six-hundred page novel&#39;, but concluded that the book was &#39;brilliantly written&#39;, and &#39;should be read as a parable&#39;. It follows the career of Undine Spragg, recently arrived in New York from the Midwest and determined to conquer high society. Glamorous, selfish, mercenary, and manipulative, her principal assets are her striking beauty, her tenacity, and her father&#39;s money. With her sights set on an advantageous marriage, Undine pursues her schemes in a world of shifting values, where triumph is swiftly followed by disillusion. Wharton was re-creating an environment she knew intimately, and Undine&#39;s education for social success is chronicled in meticulous detail. The novel superbly captures the world of post-Civil War America, as ruthless in its social ambitions as in its business and politics.</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesHighly acclaimed at its publication in 1913, The Custom of the Country is a cutting commentary on America&#39;s nouveaux riches, their upward-yearning aspirations and their eventual downfalls. Through her heroine, the beautiful and ruthless Undine Spragg, a spoiled heiress who looks to her next materialistic triumph as her latest conquest throws himself at her feet, Edith Wharton presents a startling, satiric vision of social behavior in all its greedy glory. As Undine moves from America&#39;s heartland to Manhattan, and then to Paris, Wharton&#39;s critical eye leaves no social class unscathed.</p><h2>Medieval Russia&#39;s Epics, Chronicles and Tales: Revised and Enlarged Edition</h2><p>First published in 1963, this unique and pioneering anthology has been continuously used as an invaluable text in Russian studies.

First used as battlefield strategy, camps have evolved with each passing decade, in the scope of their effects and the savage practicality with which governments have employed them. Even in the twenty-first century, as we continue to reckon with the magnitude and horror of the Holocaust, history tells us we have broken our own solemn promise of "never again."<br><br>In this harrowing work based on archival records and interviews during travel to four continents, Andrea Pitzer reveals for the first time the chronological and geopolitical history of concentration camps. Beginning with 1890s Cuba, she pinpoints concentration camps around the world and across decades. From the Philippines and Southern Africa in the early twentieth century to the Soviet Gulag and detention camps in China and North Korea during the Cold War, camp systems have been used as tools for civilian relocation and political repression. Often justified as a measure to protect a nation, or even the interned groups themselves, camps have instead served as brutal and dehumanizing sites that have claimed the lives of millions.<br><br>Drawing from exclusive testimony, landmark historical scholarship, and stunning research, Andrea Pitzer unearths the roots of this appalling phenomenon, exploring and exposing the staggering toll of the camps: our greatest atrocities, the extraordinary survivors, and even the intimate, quiet moments that have also been part of camp life during the past century.</p><p>Andrea Pitzer is the author of <i>The Secret History of Vladimir Nabokov</i>.

And David Brancaccio, host of NOW on PBS, wrote: "<i>As the host for a decade of a daily business program, I had to read what seemed like every business book published in the English language. It is, therefore, with authority that I can say Paul Orfalea&#x2019;s book is wonderful, heartbreaking, and profoundly useful</i>."<br><br> Now in paperback, <i>Copy This!</i>, Paul Orfale's memoir of turning lemons into lemonade, is wise, personal, funny, unflinchingly honest, and filled with wisdom, business lessons, and his inspired Orfalea Aphorisms. It's the story of how a struggling kid who could barely read, write, or sit still managed to grow a 100-square-foot copy shop named Kinko's into a $1.5 billion empire that Fortune named one of the best places in America to work. And it's the story of an individual who saw his learning disabilities&#x2014;ADHD and dyslexia&#x2014;as learning opportunities, which molded the homegrown, compassionate culture that allowed Kinko's to thrive, and guided the behavior of a CEO who had no choice but to think different. A terrifically entertaining read from a born storyteller, but with the hardcore guts of true business acumen, <i>Copy This!</i> will blow fresh air into the thinking of any manager, entrepreneur, executive, or business owner.</p><p>A charismatic, heart-warming business memoir that&#x2019;s filled with life lessons on overcoming obstacles, <em>Copy This! </em>is a book for every business owner looking to grow a company, every manager helping his team perform, every visionary trying to launch a new idea&#x2014;and for every mother and father of a child suffering from dyslexia or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Because <em>Copy This!</em> is the story of how Paul Orfalea opened a small copy shop called Kinko&#x2019;s in 1970 and turned it into a $1.5 billion-a-year company, while barely being able to read, write, or sit still through a business meeting. <br><br>Here is the story of a dyslexic, hyperactive boy who flunked two grades&#x2014;yet succeeded in using his learning differences as opportunities, molding the compassionate, unconventional, partner-driven culture that allowed Kinko&#x2019;s to thrive, and made it, according to <em>Fortune</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>Mother Jones</em>, one of the best places in America to work. In fourteen chapters narrated with the engaging voice of a born storyteller, Orfalea takes as much pleasure in discussing his shortcomings as he does his successes, and imparts the valuable lessons he&#x2019;s learned along the way: Manage the environment, not the people. Fail forward. Be &#x201c;on&#x201d; your business, not &#x201c;in&#x201d; your business. Let your soul catch up with your body. Keep a poker face&#x2014;and a poker mind. And know when&#x2014;and how&#x2014;to walk away. Which Orfalea did in 2000, having made millionaires out of dozens of his friends and partners, after an extraordinary 30-year run.<em>Copy This!</em>, Paul Orfalea's inspiring, personal story of turning lemons into lemonade, may be the most unusual business memoir ever published.<br> <br> Paul Orfalea struggles mightily to read, to write, and to sit still through a business meeting. So what's the problem? By working with the obstacles life dealt him&#x2014;he calls his dyslexia and ADHD "learning opportunities"&#x2014;he grew a 100-square-foot copy shop named Kinko's into a $1.5 billion-a-year company that <em>Fortune</em> named one of the best places in America to work. <br> <br> This is the story of a boy who flunked out of second grade&#x2014;a boy who was fired by a gas station for writing illegible receipts. But it's also the story of a boy who learned from the world directly, who was brave enough to fail, who knew he had to rely on other people. A boy who developed empathy, a particular gift of his dyslexia that gave Orfalea the crucial insight into what makes Kinko's work. When Paul Orfalea first looked out on the worried, hopeful faces of his customers, he knew that he was in the problem-solving business&#x2014;at four cents a page. Kinko's doesn't so much handle paper as it handles dreams. <br> <br> Paul Orfalea really did do it his way. With humor, wisdom, and compassion, he shares his invaluable experiences and unorthodox business lessons with the millions of those who are just a little bit "different," and who wonder if there's a place for them in the world.

"We are privileged to be around at a time when he is writing." <i>Flow Chart</i>, a book-length poem that first appeared in 1991, might be Ashbery's greatest creation: a staggering and exuberant "torrent of invention [that] comes as close to an epic poem as our postmodern, nonlinear, deconstructed sensibilities will allow. . . .

Stevenson Jr., Professor of Language and Literature at Bard College and lives in New York City and Hudson, New York.<br><br>Ashbery invents and reinvents his self in this book-length stream-of-consciousness poem. In manically articulate free verse of long, supple lines, he conjures a secular landscape dotted with shadows of ancient gods, wherein he ferrets out "signs of life in the land of waiting." Bathos sets the mood: Alvin and the Chipmunks, Osiris, Mercury and Argus share common ground. Everyday reality is transmuted by imagination, wish, memory, and by the poet's romantic dialogues with an unnamed significant other. Is the universe a big joke, or is there meaning, perhaps even an organizing principle, behind it? Are free will and predestination reconcilable? How does one move beyond "a lifetime of self-loathing and shallow interests"? Ashbery ( Some Trees ) weaves a haunted, haunting music around these and other big questions, squeezing joy, ennui, despair, hope and a thirst for belonging out of ordinary experience. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Yellowstone Wildlife: Ecology and Natural History of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</h2><p><i>Yellowstone Wildlife </i>is a natural history of the wildlife species that call Yellowstone National Park and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem their home.

Yet confidence in the money supply is a recent phenomenon: prior to the Civil War, the United States did not have a single, national currency. Instead, countless banks issued paper money in a bewildering variety of denominations and designs--more than ten thousand different kinds by 1860. Counterfeiters flourished amid this anarchy, putting vast quantities of bogus bills into circulation. </p><p> Their success, Stephen Mihm reveals, is more than an entertaining tale of criminal enterprise: it is the story of the rise of a country defined by a freewheeling brand of capitalism over which the federal government exercised little control. It was an era when responsibility for the country's currency remained in the hands of capitalists for whom "making money" was as much a literal as a figurative undertaking. </p><p> Mihm's witty tale brims with colorful characters: shady bankers, corrupt cops, charismatic criminals, and brilliant engravers. Based on prodigious research, it ranges far and wide, from New York City's criminal underworld to the gold fields of California and the battlefields of the Civil War. We learn how the federal government issued greenbacks for the first time and began dismantling the older monetary system and the counterfeit economy it sustained. </p><p> <i>A Nation of Counterfeiters</i> is a trailblazing work of history, one that casts the country's capitalist roots in a startling new light. Readers will recognize the same get-rich-quick spirit that lives on in the speculative bubbles and confidence games of the twenty-first century. </p></p><p>Stephen Mihm is Assistant Professor of History at University of Georgia.Mihm brings to teeming life a world most Americans never knew existed, a world in which every single purchase was inflected with an additional layer of anxiety about the very currency in which the purchase was to be transacted.

There really is nothing like it in the literature.<br> --Bruce H. Mann, Harvard Law School<br><br>Stephen Mihm's elegant study demonstrates that 'making money' once had a more literal meaning, when thousands of banks printed their own currency notes and numerous counterfeiters profitably imitated them. Mihm offers an absorbing and enlightening history of the complex relations between money, national stability, and the forging of American character.<br> --Richard Sylla, New York University<br><br>With imaginative research and crystalline prose, Stephen Mihm casts unprecedented light on the confidence games at the heart of early American capitalism. He also introduces us to an irresistible cast of characters, whose brazen exploits provide a new frame for understanding nineteenth century economic debate. <i>A Nation of Counterfeiters</i> is a brilliant synthesis of business and cultural history.

No wonder! After all, the man could do just about anything. Why, he was an author and an athlete and a patriot and a scientist and an inventor to boot. He even found a way to steal the lightning right out of the sky.</p> <p>Is such a thing possible? Is it. Take a look inside and find Ben busy at work on every spread. Then find out how he used his discovery about lightning to make people's lives safer.</p><p>In an inventive way, Rosalyn Schanzer brings us a brilliant and ever-curious American original.</p></p><p><p>Patricia Lauber is the highly acclaimed author of, among others, <em>Volcano</em>, a Newbery Honor Book, and <em>Flood</em>, a <em>School Library Journal</em> Best Book of the Year. Her fascination with horses began in childhood, when she loved to read about them. She learned to ride, and at the age of twelve spent a memorable summer on a ranch in New Mexico. Patricia Lauber lives with her husband in New Canaan, Connecticut.</p><p>Rosalyn Schanzer has written and illustrated several outstanding children's books, including her <em>How We Crossed the West</em>, which received starred reviews from <em>School Library Journal</em> and <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, and, most recently, <em>Gold Fever! </em>As a child, she always enjoyed reading stories about horses. By the time the artist was twelve years old, she'd read all of the Black Stallion books, by Walter Farley; then she studied the muscle structures of horses so that she could draw them herself. Rosalyn Schanzer lives with her husband, Steve, their children, Adam and Kim, and their family dog, Jones, in Fairfax Station, Virginia.</p><p>Patricia Lauber and Rosalyn Schanzer recently collaborated on <em>The True-or-False Book of Cats</em>, which <em>School Library Journal</em> called "A delightful look at the behavior of these popular pets ... A book that will frequently stray from the shelf."</p>As with her How We Crossed the West: The Adventures of Lewis and Clark, Schanzer's lively writing and drawing style again makes history come alive. Here she gives appropriate spark to a picture-book overview of Benjamin Franklin's various inventions and scientific experiments, zeroing in on his discovery of lightning's electric power. The statement "It's true!" begins the exhilarating ride. From there the author summarizes, in a succinct and zippy style, many of Franklin's achievements as inventor, statesman, author, entrepreneur, activist, community leader and musician-a Renaissance man of boundless energy ("Didn't the man ever stop to rest?" she wonders). The artwork, a combination of vibrantly colored dyes and ink line, depicts an ebullient Franklin smiling, with his hair flying, as he flits from one role to the next. But the author devotes a significant portion of the book to Franklin's curiosity about electricity (which he believed to be found in lightning) and its potential to cause devastating fires, including the story behind Franklin's famous experiment of flying a kite with a key on its string during a thunderstorm. The compositions, which include period detail and accessible illustrated renditions of Franklin's documented projects and inventions, match the chipper tone of the text. An extensive author's note provides further information on Franklin's life and works, and spiffy endpapers reproduce diagrams and notes from Franklin's papers in Philadelphia's American Philosophical Society. This fitting tribute to a memorable leader emphasizes the playfulness that accompanies a curious mind and the boundless energy required for great accomplishments.

And these are only some of the fanciful creations that populate these literary treasures!</p></p><p>During his life, Gerald Tyrwhitt, the 14th Baron Berners, made his reputation as a composer of ballet and opera scores, but he was also an entertaining memoirist and a crafter of sly and funny tales. In <i>First Childhood</i> and <i>A Distant Prospect</i>, he depicted the realities of growing up Victorian; in <i>Collected Tales and Fantasies</i>, he examines his privileged world through a medium that is no less true for being fiction. Berners relies on humor to make his points, but there's nothing remotely gentle in his mockery. Take, for example, "The Camel," an absurd tale of an ecclesiastical couple whose life is undone by a dromedary's mysterious appearance on their doorstep. Or "Percy Wallingford," in which the title character, a young man entirely without fault, begins to crumble when he discovers his wife has amazing night vision and can see him at his most defenseless: while he is asleep. In the world of Berners's making, even the most innocuous or ridiculous of events can lead to serious consequences indeed, and each of the six tales included in this volume has its dark side. Misdirected love letters, antique embroidery, little dogs that are loved and loathed in equal measure--from such off-kilter seeds, full-blown satire blooms, and readers who like their humor spiced with just a dash of arsenic will embrace this underappreciated writer. <i>--Margaret Prior</i>Bernerss follow-up to his memoirs (First Childhood; A Distant Prospect; both 1998) displays his gift for pleasantly campy patrician fiction in the form of the short novel. His real name was Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners (18831950). He was called ``the English Satie'' (composer of an opera with Gertrude Stein, a ballet for Diaghilev); he painted capably in the manner of Corot; he was lampooned by Nancy Mitford, in The Pursuit of Love, as the whimsical Lord Merlin; and he kept hundreds of brightly dyed pink pigeons on his lavish country estate at Farringdon. The winking little comedies here (apparently in their first US publication) at times present the authors young male friends as naughty schoolgirls with Berners himself as their headmistress. ``Percy Wallingford'' draws a picture of the perfect specimen, a male of absolute accomplishment on the playing field and everywhere else, whose supreme charisma can draw guests to an otherwise dull weekend gathering. The infallible Wallingford, who cant stand to be bested at anything, marries Vera, who, alas, can see in the dark and observe Wallingford while he sleeps. This so torments, disorders, confuses, and cramps him that he begins to suspect that everyone else has at least one secret gift superior to his. When Vera dies of accidental suffocation, Wallingford falls into suicidal remorse on the eve of WWI. In The Camel,'' a humped four- legger appears on a vicarage front porch and becomes a surreal good fairy. When Antonia, the vicar's wife, begins riding the camel about the parish, the thankful animal makes all her wishes come true, though its absurd abilities lead at last to tragedy. ``Count Omega'' finds Berners lampooning fellow composer William Walton, who falls in love with Gloria, a larger-than-life trombonist who, like the archangel Gabriel, emits a golden light when she plays. Should lead to a gala Berners rebirth among cultists of the ultra-elegant. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For no serpent smites<br> <br>Along the ground. Instead, it bites<br> <br>And leaves no sound.<br> <br>*<br> I.<p></p> <br>Robert Highstead&#x2019;s workday ended with a letter thrust inside his pocket. Before that, it was spent in a second-story parlor in Kensington, squinting into a camera at a corpse.<br> <br>Through the camera&#x2019;s viewing glass, Robert watched a young woman lying as if asleep, her hands cupped against her breast like she&#x2019;d been called to cradle a dove. She appeared upside down on the viewing glass as though floating. It was a pose Robert had witnessed hundreds of times in the past three years: the serene smile upon the lips, the closed eyelids, the awkwardly draped shawl across the shoulders that a loved one took upon herself to orchestrate. A last display of care before consignment to the grave. The only variant today was a small book, The Lost History of Dreams, by an author Robert had never heard of. The volume was splayed across the woman&#x2019;s belly, as though she&#x2019;d just set it down to rest her eyes.<br> <br>The thin cry of an infant revealed the cause of the woman&#x2019;s demise. From the blood-stiffened linens thrown in a heap against a limewashed wall to the slack-shouldered midwife napping beside the wash basin, Robert understood the woman had labored long and hard. &#x201c;The noblest of sacrifices,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her sister and husband, to help them grasp whatever comfort they could. Their muffled sobs gave hint to the ineffectuality of language. The winter air inside the parlor was weighed with the tinge of iron despite the geraniums set on the window ledge, the ice beneath the coffin boards. Not that it mattered&#x2014;after all, Robert had work to do. He needed to be in Belgravia in two hours for a thirteen-year-old consumptive whose family yearned for a last portrait while she could still acknowledge their presence.<br> <br>Robert unlatched a long wooden box to remove the silver-coated copper plate for the daguerreotype. He&#x2019;d already buffed it to a mirrorlike sheen before exposing it to iodine and bromine fumes. As he reached toward his camera, his eyes tripped to the clock on the mantel as he thought of his wife. She hadn&#x2019;t come home the previous evening&#x2014;a not uncommon occurrence in their three years of marriage. Nor did it help that this was the third corpse he&#x2019;d daguerreotyped since breakfast. Though Robert was accustomed to such sights, today it felt too much.<br> <br>The widower, who was dressed in the modest clothes of a merchant, approached Robert, the newborn in his arms bawling. &#x201c;She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was lovely,&#x201d; he said, his eyes reddening.<br> <br>Robert tutted between his teeth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d; The more often he repeated the words, the less currency they seemed worth. He set the frame containing the plate inside the camera with a slide that felt as visceral as anything he&#x2019;d experienced of late.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now the camera is ready,&#x201d; he announced, ignoring the slight stench already rising from the corpse; the ice wasn&#x2019;t helping. &#x201c;The process will take little time, sir. Less than a minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>The widower pressed a palm against his eyes. &#x201c;I appreciate how quickly you arrived. Very good of you. My sister claims you&#x2019;re the best daguerreotypist of this sort.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise to use all the skills of my art, sir.&#x201d; Robert&#x2019;s heart lurched with sympathy; at least he still had his wife, wherever she was. She always comes back. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s anything else I can do to offer comfort&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>The widower&#x2019;s eyes fixed on Robert with a wet desperation. &#x201c;Can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can you make her look as she did when she was alive, Mr. Highstead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, I understand! The daguerreotype will record your wife so your daughter&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Son. We&#x2019;re naming him Charles. After her.&#x201d; The widower indicated his wife&#x2019;s corpse with a tight nod. &#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s name was Charlotte. Those who care for her called her Lottie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then your son Charles will have something by which to recall his dear mother&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert next took out a thick binder from his satchel. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d care to look at our Catalogue of Possibilities,&#x201d; he said mildly, setting it before the widower. The leather binding was gilded with the motto &#x201c;Secure the shadow &#x2019;ere the substance fade.&#x201d; The catalogue showed a journeyman&#x2019;s ransom of items to spill shillings on. The silver-bordered frame bearing a capsule for a lock of hair. The velvet-lined glass mounts. The alternate views of the departed. Images of the family gathered around the corpse, faces pinched from the effort of not shifting for the camera. The stillborn babies supported by black-cloaked figures.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are they alive?&#x201d; the widower asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; Robert replied. He possessed little pride for his ability to pose an infant in a mother&#x2019;s lifeless arms without the exposure blurring. A few drops of Mother Bailey&#x2019;s Quieting Syrup worked wonders, though he hated how it affected the child. Yet there was something about his employment Robert couldn&#x2019;t turn from. Something compelling. He told himself it was because he was offering comfort by transforming loss into proof of memory. Sometimes the daguerreotype seemed like sorcery itself, especially when he saw the image emerge from the plate like a ghost from the ethers. But it was more than this.<br> <br>&#x201c;For an additional fee, the image can be hand-tinted,&#x201d; Robert added, pointing at a colored daguerreotype. Pink-hued gum arabic over silver foil. Flesh over bones.<br> <br>Once coins were exchanged and bills of sale signed, Robert began the delicate process of daguerreotyping the corpse. He steadied his breath as he stared through the glass. He took the lens cap off with a flash of his palm, letting light record shadow on the plate. He ignored the widower&#x2019;s sobs, the tearful last confessions of love. After all, they weren&#x2019;t directed for his ears, but to those who could no longer hear. As Robert counted down the seconds of exposure, he anticipated what he would find when he developed the daguerreotype. For he knew in each person&#x2019;s image he would discover the lost history of their lives: the scars, the wrinkles, the dreams never fulfilled. Or, worse, the lack thereof.<br> <br>And then a messenger had walked in and thrust the letter into Robert&#x2019;s pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you find me?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d asked the messenger, a towheaded boy of no more than fifteen. But the messenger had no answer, for he was already out the door.<br> <br>The letter remained unopened for the remainder of Robert&#x2019;s afternoon. But it was not forgotten: he&#x2019;d found himself unable to daguerreotype the consumptive in Belgravia, the first time he&#x2019;d ever not shown for a client.<br> <br>Instead of taking a carriage after he&#x2019;d received the letter, Robert used his disturbance as an excuse to walk toward Clerkenwell. Toward home. He hoped the exercise would calm him. The simplest thing would be to read the letter. To learn the worst. He couldn&#x2019;t. Not yet.<br> <br>He detoured along Oxford Street, though it took him out of his way. Even on a frigid February day, Oxford Street offered the distraction of shop-lined pavements crowded with silk-clad pedestrians. Such was the effect of Robert&#x2019;s step&#x2014;he dragged his left leg to compensate for the weight of his daguerreotype traveling case&#x2014;that some paused in his wake. Robert understood their interest wasn&#x2019;t because he was particularly handsome. With his thick pale hair and fair skin, his were the type of looks better described as sensitive than arresting; even now, three years after he&#x2019;d left Oxford, he resembled the scholar of history he&#x2019;d been. It was because Robert understood that even they, strangers to him in every sense of the word, knew there was something about him. Something somber. He noted their attention, but he&#x2019;d grown used to it in the same way a butcher ignores the flies buzzing about his shop. After so much time daguerreotyping corpses, Robert understood death hung off him. Sometimes he imagined it possessing a physical form, like a martyr in a Flemish painting. Other times he fretted he smelled of decay, though he washed his hands nightly in carbolic acid followed by castile soap. This regimen left the skin on his hands reddened, but he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to forego it.<br> <br>By the time Robert approached Theobald Road, the shock of the letter still hadn&#x2019;t worn off. He walked quickly, bypassing narrow lanes snaking up into fog-draped indistinction. His pace only slowed once he turned left on Grays Inn Lane at the intersection where it met Laystall Street. His boarding house.<br> <br>He ascended the four flights of stairs to his room, ignoring his landlady&#x2019;s solicitous greeting. He didn&#x2019;t bother to ask whether his wife had returned home; he knew Mrs. Clarke never noticed Sida&#x2019;s comings and goings. Anyway, for once Sida didn&#x2019;t dominate his worries. Mrs. Clarke&#x2019;s orange-striped tabby followed him upstairs, mewing plaintively. The cat understood Robert was good for a saucer of milk, but not today.<br> <br>Once his door was shut, Robert settled the traveling case onto the floor in the room.<br> <br>The room was enough for his needs. It contained a bed, a milk-painted dresser, a table the width of his lap for meals, and two wicker chairs. A long worktable held a glittering stack of silvered copper plates he&#x2019;d begun polishing with pumice powder and oil; his business required a constant supply. Quarter plates, which measured about three by four inches, were Robert&#x2019;s favorite, for they required only his compact Richebourg daguerreotype outfit. He didn&#x2019;t like to work with daguerreotypes smaller than this&#x2014;too hard to view without a magnifying glass. He possessed a camera expressly for this purpose, but preferred not to carry it along with the quarter-plate one. However, if business improved, he planned to invest in a newer American-style full-plate camera. As for the room itself, its walls were angled. No art could be hung on them, which perturbed Sida, who liked to draw, but the view from the windows was compensation. They looked out on chimney pots and muddled skies, where birds collected at dusk. On clear days, he could even spy St. Paul&#x2019;s to the south. When it grew foggy, Robert swore he could see coal dust suspended midair. The dust would enter his room, lining the plates in grey even after he closed the windows. Regardless, he preferred the windows open despite coal dust and the occasional errant crow at dusk.<br> <br>Tonight the room was empty of crows. It was also empty of Sida.<br> <br>Robert sank onto their bed, uncertain if he was relieved or disappointed she wasn&#x2019;t there. If the letter&#x2019;s sender was as expected, it might upset her more than him.<br> <br>Relieved, he decided. Better she not know. She&#x2019;ll return. She always does. Yet he feared this time would be different.<br> <br>What troubled Robert most about Sida&#x2019;s absences wasn&#x2019;t the possibility of her betraying him; he knew she was too devoted for that. Nor was it loneliness; Robert was the sort of man who found as much companionship in a book as he did in humanity. It was that he never understood the perimeters of her comings and goings.<br> <br>When they were together, Robert knew his marriage was a fair trade. Apart, it was difficult to think of anything save Sida&#x2019;s unpredictable ways. He often wished he could stay home to watch over her. He&#x2019;d bring her pomegranate seeds and mint tea, red wine and gentle kisses. He&#x2019;d provide her with peace. But this could never be. Though Robert was the son of landed gentry, he&#x2019;d abandoned his land right after they&#x2019;d married.<br> <br>The letter reasserted its hold. He glanced anew at the door. What if Sida showed? To distract himself, he&#x2019;d read. Ovid&#x2019;s Metamorphoses would do. While at Oxford, he&#x2019;d written an acclaimed history of Ovid&#x2019;s world. His second book, a biography of Ovid, had been slow work: the poet had spent the later part of his life in undocumented exile.<br> <br>Still, the comfort of old obsessions called. He shifted the book onto his chest and read in Latin: Eurydice, dying now a second time, uttered no complaint against her husband. What was there to complain of, but that she had been loved?<br> <br>The words blurred before his sight. Sida or no, the letter would not be ignored.<br> <br>He drew the letter from his pocket like it was a snake. It was postmarked Belvedere, Kent. Where he&#x2019;d grown up. It was addressed in a hand he knew well, though he hadn&#x2019;t seen it since his marriage. His brother&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Just then the door creaked open. He let the letter slide from his fingers.<br> <br>Sida&#x2019;s form was silhouetted against sunlight from the landing. She was wearing a blue-grey silk gown, the one she&#x2019;d married him in. The sleeves were unusually full about the shoulders, a style she was fond of. He ignored the dark stains marring the bodice; they hadn&#x2019;t been able to launder them out. Robert&#x2019;s eyes passed hungrily over her. Sida looked as she ever did: petite, fine-boned, doe-eyed. Her ebony hair was unplaited about her shoulders, damp from an unseen rain. The moisture brought out the gleaming curls of her hair, which reminded him of a Titian Madonna he&#x2019;d shown her at the National Gallery, the first time she&#x2019;d ever viewed art in a museum.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re back,&#x201d; he said, hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t notice the letter on the floor. &#x201c;I missed you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sida smiled in answer, letting her Kashmir shawl drop as she approached him. The shawl was one her father had brought from India; he&#x2019;d been a lascar who&#x2019;d married an English woman when the East India Company had brought him to London. Sida had been employed as a seamstress when Robert first met her. Later he learned her uncle had forced her into service after her parents&#x2019; death, but he hadn&#x2019;t cared. His brother had.<br> <br>He opened his arms wide. She slid into them, the gesture easy. This was what he&#x2019;d needed&#x2014;not money, not family favor, nor universities at Oxford. This was why he lived in this fourth-story room where birds trespassed at dusk.<br> <br>How light she felt in his arms! How soft! It no longer mattered that his days were spent daguerreotyping the dead. Besides, he was good at it. Instead of writing about history, he was capturing it on a silver-lined plate for generations to come. As for Sida, what did it matter she wasn&#x2019;t as she&#x2019;d been before their marriage? Neither was he. All this was proof they were fated to be together. They&#x2019;d never be parted.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Only you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert raised himself above his wife on their bed, ignoring the letter below. Whatever was in it couldn&#x2019;t be more important than her. The candle beside the bed cast shadows along her cheek, accentuating the bones beneath. He wove his fingers into hers, his skin pale against her dusky hand. He grew aroused, but didn&#x2019;t dare venture further. Instead, he rested his cheek against her breast, his hand on her waist. Her bodice was soft with moisture.<br> <br>As the room darkened with the shadows of winter, husband and wife lay together on their bed, head to head, eye to eye, Ro...</p><h2>Shop Drawings of Shaker Furniture &amp; Woodenware, Volume 3</h2><p>Clocks, sewing tables, footstools, mirrors, desks, shelves, racks, and more.</p><p>Carefully detailed, time-tested guides to building Shaker furniture and woodenware <p>"Ejner Handberg had an eye for some of the best of Shaker design.

This commentary argues that Paul's doctrine of justification by faith is essentially social in nature and has important ecumenical implications for the Church today. In its original setting, Galatians established a foundation for the unity of Jewish and Gentile Christians: all are justified by the faith of Jesus Christ.</p><p>In addition to illuminating the historical situation that led Paul to write his Letter to the Galatians, this commentary pays careful attention to the rhetorical structure of this letter and its theological message. The author provides a fresh translation of Galatians, critical notes on each verse of the text, and a careful commentary of the letter in light of Paul's theology.</p><p>Theories abound on the question of Galatians, why it was written, what it says, and what the implications of that message are. Yet few scholars have devoted themselves at length to this letter. What sets this work apart is its extent and detail, and its academic rather than popular intent.</p></p><p><p>Frank J.

We see glimpses of a horrible crime in the future, and with each successive chapter the suspense and psychological buzz gets more intense.

Warshawski inadvertently unearths old skeletons from Chicago&#39;s history and her own family, a situation marked by a young cousin she has never met and the untimely death of a nun. By the Cartier Diamond Dagger-winning author of Blacklist.</p><p><p>Sara Paretsky is the author of sixteen books, including her renowned V. I. Warshawski novels. Her many awards include the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for lifetime achievement from the British Crime Writers' Association. She lives in Chicago.</p> <p> </p>V.I. Warshawski&#39;s latest case may be the most frustrating she&#39;s encountered. The client is irritable. The job, finding the harpy&#39;s son, missing for 40 years, should be easy but isn&#39;t. And when Warshawski asks people about the missing man, they get angry and try to kill her. With her gravelly voice, narrator Susan Ericksen sounds like Kathleen Turner, who played Warshawski on the big screen. Ericksen ramps up the excitement in the story with a memorable voice that is intense and breathless. She&#39;s equally convincing as a gangbanger, a gentle nun, a kindly neighbor, and a stroke victim. Each character shines as an individual, making this one of the best Sara Paretsky productions ever.

His reading of this mystery is done in a clear British accent with careful attention to the author's directives. With his narration, each character's expressions are appropriately inflected to emphasize Crombie's dialogue. Deehy's depiction of vacationing Scotland Yard Super-intendent Duncan Kincaid underscores his cautious yet caring manner. His partner, the warmer, more excitable Sergeant Gemma James, balances the tone. Deehy applies distinctive characterizations to the cast of young and old who must help solve a string of murders lest they meet a similar fate. His superb reading doesn't miss a beat as Kincaid and James unravel the details of oddly intertwined timeshare owners to find a killer.

She has finally found the Others she has been seeking. Though Ayla must learn their different customs and language, she is adopted because of her remarkable hunting ability, singular healing skills, and uncanny fire-making technique. Bringing back the single pup of a lone wolf she has killed, Ayla shows the way she tames animals. She finds women friends and painful memories of the Clan she left behind, and meets Ranec, the dark-skinned, magnetic master carver of ivory, whom she cannot refuse--inciting Jondalar to a fierce jealousy that he tries to control by avoiding her. Unfamiliar with the ways of the Others, Ayla misunderstands, and thinking Jondalar no longer loves her, she turns more to Ranec.

A popular platform speaker and prolific tract writer, his books are still widely read across the globe.<br><br>Edited by Andrew Atherstone, this critical edition of Ryle's manuscript autobiography, dictated in 1873, is a rich and unparalleled account of the early decades of his life and ministry. He recalls his youthful pursuit of academic plaudits and sporting prowess at Eton College and Oxford University, before his evangelical conversion at the age of 21. He tells of the devastating collapse of the family bank and the enforced sale of their Cheshire estates, which ended his ambitions to enter parliament. Ryle describes his exploits as a young clergyman, his loves and losses, his evangelical networks, and the deaths of his first two wives. He offers a frank assessment of his joys and struggles, and the reasons behind his crucial life choices. Written for his children and never intended for publication, Bishop J.C. Ryle's autobiography is essential reading for a proper appreciation of the man behind the headlines in the years before he reached national and international fame.<br><br>This volume also includes many photographs from the Ryle family albums, never before published.

Isaacs, C.S. Lewis, Edmund Fuller and other scholars examining the mythological origins and literary aspects of the work.</p><p>Neil D. Isaacs, Professor Emeritus of English language and literature at the University of Maryland, lives in Colesville, Maryland.Neil D. Isaacs On the Pleasures of (Reading and Writing)Tolkien Criticism<br><br>It is almost forty-three years since Rose Zimbardo pointed me toward Middle-earth. I was a relatively late arrival, the phenomenal success of The Lord of the Rings having already been well established to the dismay of some establishment defenders of the traditional canon.<br><br>Throughout the sixties, three aspects of that phenomenon seemed to dominate perceptions of the value of the book. One was the persistent resistance by the arbiters of literary taste to afford critical recognition to a work that had proven its abundant appeal to a wide popular and, worse, youthful audience. Another was the fact that the book&#x2019;s commercial success was not the product of hype: the early popularity of The Lord of the Rings was produced by a word-ofmouth groundswell that preceded the reactive attention of the mass media. It was a matter of reporting the phenomenon rather than precipitating it, though the reportage added fuel to the &#xfb01;re.<br><br>The third was that some of the features and attractions of the book and its created world inevitably elicited an infectious outbreak of faddism and fannism, cultism and clubbism,&#x201d; as I called it in On the Possibilities of Writing Tolkien Criticism.&#x201d; In that introduction to our &#xfb01;rst collection of critical essays I was lamenting that these factors, particularly the feverish activity of the fanzines,&#x201d; were counterpro- ductive to the development of a climate for serious critical attention to Tolkien&#x2019;s masterpiece.<br><br>More than a decade after the novel&#x2019;s appearance, as an example if not a proof of the shocked attention still being paid to a literary phenomenon by an uncomprehending coterie of critics (including EdmundWilson, Germaine Greer, and Philip Toynbee), the New York Herald Tribune&#x2019;s Book Week published on its front page (February 26, 1967), beginning in large type and accompanied by a cartoon, what amounted to a confession of ignorance by a prominent critic, Paul West. Part of my response in On the Possibilities of Writing Tolkien Criticism&#x201d; neatly summarizes, I think, the nature of the problem: On what bases does West attack The Lord of the Rings?<br><br>1. He is baf&#xfb02;ed by it, baf&#xfb02;ed into numbness. I cannot argue with this; he demonstrates both baf&#xfb02;ement and numbness throughout.<br><br>2. With a nostalgia for the last century&#x2019;s discarded theories, he laments that Tolkien created his world and its creatures alone, without some folksy community origin. But if Tolkien is sole owner and proprietor of Middle-earth, I would prefer to give him all my admiration than to betray any envy for his creative imagination.<br><br>3. The Lord of the Rings is a game, only a game, and has no bearing on humanity. Now this is a serious objection, to which I would offer a pair of categorical adversatives: &#xfb01;rst, without the sense of play as an essential element in literature, we would have to do without much of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Joyce, Proust, Nabokov for in a sense all art is a game, the game of putting form to matter; second, the game of The Lord of the Rings is miraculously designed to be played and won by anyone who takes part, but the reader who doesn&#x2019;t see the signi&#xfb01;cance of its urgent bearing on humanity will always be a loser.<br><br>4. The society from which people must escape into Tolkien&#x2019;s world is very bad indeed. I offer no comment on this argument, but I wonder if West hasn&#x2019;t simply used Tolkien&#x2019;s popularity as a way to make this last general point; it has no direct (or logical) bearing on the relative excellence of the book.<br><br>It may be unfair to hold West up as epitomizing the negative attitudes toward Tolkien. After all, few attentive readers had actually been driven to the simplistic notions that the book features a virtue that triumphs untested,&#x201d; an evil that dies uninvestigated,&#x201d; and one protagonist, Frodo, who is the goodie hobbit.&#x201d; But even West acknowledged that the cultism and clubbism were irrelevant to indeed barriers to considerations of literature, that is, serious criticism.<br><br>In such a climate, Rose Zimbardo and I designed Tolkien and the Critics as a small contribution toward a major project, saving what we believed was a great novel from the faddists and button makers&#x201d; whose enthusiasm contributed to clouding some critical judgment.<br><br>An obligatory if presumptuous request to Professor Tolkien to consider supplying a brief foreword for the collection brought a gentle but &#xfb01;rm response:<br><br>I am very grateful for your attention and interest. But I am wholly occupied, or should be, with new work of my own, and I am obliged to say no&#x201d; to all requests for articles in reviews, opinions,, forewords, or anything of the kind. I think it is essential to a writer who is still writing to avoid the distraction of external criticism, however sensitive or well-informmed.<br><br>That the contributions toooo our book were to varying degrees sensitive and well-informed&#x201d; may be attested to by the warm welcome it received from reviewers. The fourteen essays, about equally divided between original pieces and reprints of the best available material, formed what one review (perhaps the least &#xfb02;attering of all) called largely an unstructured dialectic on the meaning and value of the whole trilogy.&#x201d; What was most gratifying to us about its success (as measured within the limited aspirations of academic, university press publication) was its threefold accomplishment: its samples of general appreciations by prestigious writers, its examples of illuminations of speci&#xfb01;c aspects of the novel by critics with focused interests, and its anticipations of an abundance of critical attention yet to come. In a way, the collection was an announcement of assurance that, in due course, The Lord of the Rings would have to be given its rightful place among the major &#xfb01;ctional works of our time.<br><br>Within the following decade an astonishing amount of critical work on Tolkien appeared. The variety of critical approaches that Middle-earth had spawned was as great as that of the imagined species in Tolkien&#x2019;s world, a kind of secondary sub-creation.&#x201d; There were doctoral dissertations and papers at professional meetings, guides for innocent readers, collections of learned essays, memoirs, bibliographies, explorations of source material, and contextualizings fromone perspective or another. The enormous appeal of The Lord of the Rings had spread to include not only its increasing mass audience but also a cottage industry of scholarly study. Medievalists and philologists had a &#xfb01;eld day mining the rich veins of their disciplines&#x2019; ore with tools both venerable and au courant. Allegorists of many persuasions, especially of the Christian and historical orientations, had their innings. And the psychological, the archetypal, and the structuralist schools were staking their claims.<br><br>Into this thick growth Zimbardo and Isaacs ventured once more, proposing a second collection. Dissuaded from calling it Tolkien and the Critics II&#x201d; or some variation of The Second Generation,&#x201d; we settled for Tolkien: New Critical Perspectives. If we had been motivated the &#xfb01;rst time around by the wish to justify Tolkien&#x2019;s admission to the canon, we now faced the more formidable task of separating well-intentioned appreciations of The Lord of the Rings and the proliferating attention to extraneous, external, tangential, devotional, and personal matters from what we regarded as appropriate approaches to the book that would foster substantial literary criticism.<br><br>In most ways, the second collection was as good as the &#xfb01;rst.<br>Equally divided, again, between reprinted and original material, it may have lacked the clout of contributions by C. S. Lewis and W. H.<br>Auden. But it made up for that, in part, by including a chapter from Paul Kocher&#x2019;s Master of Middle-earth, at that point the best booklength study of Tolkien&#x2019;s work, and an original essay by Verlyn Flieger, her &#xfb01;rst published work on her way to a distinguished career as a scholar of Tolkien in particular and of fantasy and Fa�rie in general.<br><br>Our second collection received much less attention from reviewers, but one astute critic, in an otherwise favorable notice, took me to task for an ill-tempered&#x201d; introduction, On the Need for Writing Tolkien Criticism.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right; the book was marred by my approach, which focused not on the strength of the collected contributions but on carping critiques of material we had deemed unworthy of inclusion.<br>Looking back, I &#xfb01;nd this indefensible, but I believe I know the reason for my critical distemper (though I would leave the differential diagnosis of mood disorder or personality disorder to others). It was that the publication of The Silmarillion, some four years before our second collection, had altered both the public perception of, and the critical climate for, Tolkien&#x2019;s work.<br><br>The problem was a double-edged sword. On one hand, critics with negative attitudes toward The Lord of the Rings used The Silmarillion to bolster their positions, disregarding the wholly different natures of the two works and illogically applying their distaste for the latter to the former. On the other hand, devotees used The Silmarillion to range far beyond The Lord of the Rings in their enthusiasm for Tolkien&#x2019;s created world, thereby de&#xfb02;ecting attention from, and appreciation for, a major work of &#xfb01;ction, in precisely the ways we had feared. Of the provision of new scripts for video games to come I will not speak here.<br><br>There may well have been as much sadness as anger in my mood vis-r-vis Tolkien scholarship and readership at the time, as a couple of short passages from my review of The Silmarillion featured in the Washington Star on Sunday, September 11, 1977, will attest:<br><br>The Silmarillion is a sacred text. It is an editor&#x2019;s attempt to set forth in an orderly way a great body of traditions, lore, and mythology that stands behind the great narrative of The Lord of the Rings. It is cosmogonical, cosmological, and apocalyptic. It is also a seemingly endless series of names (personal and place) and events chronicled without the distinction of detail that would temper the repetitiveness. Above all it is solemn, as be&#xfb01;ts a sacred text.<br><br>Readers who love The Lord of the Rings for its narrative power, its droll charm, its intricate playfulness, and the physical and psychological details that give life to its fully realized world will not be very happy with The Silmarillion. Its style will stun many, particularly those who know Tolkien as the author of Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics,&#x201d; still the most lucid and readable essay in all Old English scholarship. This book is persistently Biblical. The Book of Numbers comes most often to mind. And so it is that, beyond all hope, Christopher son of J.R.R. has brought the new Tolkien to light in the world of men.<br><br>That the ill temper faded over time I attribute not to any mellowing but to an appreciation for later developments. With Christopher Tolkien&#x2019;s gathering, editing, and publishing of successive volumes of the history, legends, lore, and mythology of Middle-earth, there came a plethora of rewards for the devotees. But the voices of carping critics faded in large part, I think, because the attention of serious literary scholarship to The Lord of the Rings reinforced the book&#x2019;s importance and won its canonical recognition even as it attracted new generations of a mass readership.<br><br>One great fear remained. Translated to the screen, I thought, the book would be reduced and its meaning lost to serious readers.However, as soon as we saw Peter Jackson&#x2019;s The Fellowship of the Ring all such fears dissipated. Indeed, the monumental triumph of Jackson&#x2019;s movies has given us a road back to Middle-earth, a road already well traveled by yet another generation of appreciative readers.<br><br>From the moment Rose Zimbardo &#xfb01;rst suggested to me that it was time for us to conclude our own trilogy of Tolkien essay collections, I have thought of this edition as a greatest hits album.&#x201d; Such an enterprise has its own built-in pitfalls for the compilers, not to mention the writer of the liner notes. Why the obvious Pretty Woman&#x201d; for the Roy Orbison selection and not the more representative Ooby-Dooby&#x201d;? Why the Licia Albanese reading of Puccini&#x2019;s Vissi d&#x2019;arte&#x201d; and not a remastered Claudia Muzio? In any case we are obligated to spell out our general criteria for choices which are certain to be challenged.<br><br>Our &#xfb01;rst decisions were nearly automatic. We intended to collect the best critical work available that focused on The Lord of the Rings. Moreover, we had no intention of presenting a balanced&#x201d; view. There would be no representative of those voices strident, cynical, sardonic, dismissive, supercilious, condescending that articulated negative views of the book. All the naysayers had one thing in common. Whether they objected to prose style, poetic insertions, assumed allegorical simplicities, self-indulgent allusiveness, character stereotyping, derivative clich�s, sociopolitical bias, Christian apologetics, or puerile taste, to make their case they all had to shift focus away from the story.<br><br>The Lord of the Rings is an adventure story par excellence, and as such it is one of the great works of twentieth-century &#xfb01;ction. If it has elements of myth, archetype, epic structure, and adolescent fantasy, not to mention deep moral, psychological, and geopolitical insights, so much the better for its performance as narrative. This collection assumes that argument about the value and power of The Lord of the Rings has been settled, certainly to the satisfaction of its vast, grow- ing, persistent audience, but also of a considerable body of critical judgment. (For a summary of the case, with explicit refutation of the losing arguments, we refer readers to Tom Shippey&#x2019;s book J.R.R.<br>Tolkien: Author of the Century.)<br><br>Another early decision was to eschew biographical approaches, of which there are many available. From personal memoirs to carefully documented accounts, this material is often charming or illuminating, particularly when it places Tolkien&#x2019;s experience in such broader contexts as the group of his fellows called Inklings, his experiences in World War I, and his immersion in medieval languages and literature.Without denying the validity of the many connections between the author&#x2019;s life and his work, we determined to focus on the latter. That decision has cost us the option of reprinting an excerpt from Humphrey Carpenter&#x2019;s estimable biography, but that book is still available in print.<br><br>We extended that principle of focus into a much broader criterion of exclusion. Many worthy pieces of individual scholarship exploring speci&#xfb01;c aspects of Tolkien&#x2019;s work linguistic discoveries, individual sources and analogues, the poetics of the interpolated verse, the evolution of invented &#xfb02;ora and fauna, the rich realms of the naming of things and creatures, and even a herd of hobbyhorses ridden by idiosyncratic interpreters can provide insight into particular features of the novel. But the typical tendency in them is toward digression, and our intention was to choose the work of critics who kept their focus on the main chance, whose eyes were ever on the prize: general appreciation of Tolkien&#x2019;s narrative art. This decision may have cost us some intriguing slants upon the work, but it also shielded us from the onslaught of continuing allegorical interpretations and assumptions.<br><br>We were ever mindful of the need to avoid super&#xfb01;ciality and redundancy.<br>The &#xfb01;nal choices, however, should exemplify our standards of importance, timeliness, and the likeliho...</p><h2>The Henry Miller Reader (New Directions Paperbook, 269)</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of works spanning the entire career of great 20th-century American writer Henry Miller, edited and introduced by Lawrence Durrell.</strong></p> In 1958, when Henry Miller was elected to membership in the American Institute of Arts and Letters, the citation described him as: "The veteran author of many books whose originality and richness of technique are matched by the variety and daring of his subject matter. His boldness of approach and intense curiosity concerning man and nature are unequalled in the prose literature of our times." It is most fitting that this anthology of "the best" of Henry Miller should have been assembled by one of the first among Miller&#x2019;s contemporaries to recognize his genius, the eminent British writer Lawrence Durrell. Drawing material from a dozen different books Durrell has traced the main line and principal themes of the "single, endless autobiography" which is Henry Miller&#x2019;s life work. "I suspect," writes Durrell in his Introduction, "that Miller&#x2019;s final place will be among those towering anomalies of authorship like Whitman or Blake who have left us, not simply works of art, but a corpus of ideas which motivate and influence a whole cultural pattern." Earlier, H. L. Mencken had said, "his is one of the most beautiful prose styles today," and the late Sir Herbert Read had written that "what makes Miller distinctive among modern writers is his ability to combine, without confusion, the aesthetic and prophetic functions." Included are stories, "portraits" of persons and places, philosophical essays, and aphorisms. For each selection Miller himself prepared a brief commentary which fits the piece into its place in his life story. This framework is supplemented by a chronology from Miller&#x2019;s birth in 1891 up to the spring of 1959, a bibliography, and, as an appendix, an open letter to the Supreme Court of Norway written in protest of the ban on Sexus, a part of which appears in this volume.</p><p><p><strong>Henry Miller</strong> (1891&#x2015;1980) was one of the most controversial American novelists during his lifetime. His book, <em>The Tropic of Cancer</em>, was banned in the some U.S. states before being overruled by the Supreme Court. New Directions publishes several of his books.</p><p><strong>Lawrence Durrell</strong> is best known for <em>The Alexandria Quartet</em>.</p>&#x201c;American literature today begins and ends with the meaning of what Miller has done.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lawrence Durrell</strong></p><h2>A Treasury of Christmas Miracles: True Stories of Gods Presence Today (Miracle Books Collection)</h2><p>This collection of true stories from bestselling author Karen Kingsbury celebrates the mystery and wonder of Christmastime.</p><p>Karen Kingsbury is the author of 14 inspirational books, including A Time to Dance,When Joy Came to Stay, and A Moment of Weakness. She lives in Vancouver, Washington.Bestselling CBA novelist Kingsbury combines her talents in fiction and journalism to recount these true stories of Christmas miracles, which she has reworked and fictionalized slightly. The stories all reflect, to some degree, God's intervention during the Christmas season to demonstrate his love: a small plane flying in treacherous conditions is able, miraculously, to land safely; a young missionary is healed of a potentially crippling disease.

The book discusses and analyses the implications these planets may have on the human experience, dealing with each planet separately. Divided into three parts, it includes a brief history of retrograde, general attitudes towards the phenomenon and an overall discussion of retrogradation.</p><p>&#34;Geocentricity might well be egocentricity&#34;. The phenomenon of retrograde motion is based on our Earth-centered view of the solar system, but the movement and cycles of retrograde planets are based entirely on the apparent motion of the Sun through the zodiac.

Known to her coworkers as the Queen of Cuba, she was an overachiever who advanced quickly through the ranks of Latin American specialists to become the intelligence community's top analyst on Cuban affairs. But throughout her sixteen-year career at DIA, Montes was sending Castro some of America's most closely guarded secrets and at the same time helping influence what the United States thought it knew about Cuba. When she was finally arrested in September 2001, she became the most senior American intelligence official ever accused of operating as a Cuban spy from within the federal U.S. government. Unrepentant as she serves out her time in a federal prison in Texas, Montes remains the only member of the intelligence community ever convicted of espionage on behalf of the Cuban government.</p><br><p>This inside account of the investigation that led to her arrest has been written by Scott W. Carmichael, the DIA's senior counterintelligence investigator who persuaded the FBI to launch an investigation. Although Montes did not fit the FBI's profile of a spy and easily managed to defeat the agency's polygraph exams, Carmichael became suspicious of her activities and with the FBI over a period of several years developed a solid case against her. Here he tells the story of that long and ultimately successful spy hunt. Carmichael reveals the details of their efforts to bring her to justice, offering readers a front-row seat for the first major U.S. espionage case of the twentieth century. She was arrested less than twenty-four hours before learning details of the U.S. plan to invade Afghanistan post-September 11. Motivated by ideology not money, Montes was one of the last "true believers" of the communist era. Because her arrest came just ten days after 9/11, it went largely unnoticed by the American public. This book calls attention to the grave damage Montes inflicted on U.S. security--Carmichael even implicates her in the death of a Green Beret fighting Cuban-backed insurgents in El Salvador--and the damage she would have continued to inflict had she not been caught.</p></p><p>Scott W. Carmichael, senior security and counterintelligence investigator for the Defense Intelligence Agency was the lead agent on the Ana Montes espionage investigation. His contributions to national security have earned him the DIA Civilian Expeditionary Medal and Award for Meritorious Civilian Service, the Defense Intelligence Director&#39;s Award, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence Award, and the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement. He lives n the Washington, D.C area."Several years ago, I informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation of a growing suspicion that one of our own DIA employees, Ana Belen Montes, was secretly an agent of the Cuban government. The evidence at first was weak, but I worked with the FBI over several years to develop the facts and finally bring her to justice. This book is the inside story of that long and ultimately successful spy hunt." -- <b>Scott W.

One of North America's revered spiritual teachers shares the "heart's hunger" of his troubled youth, his work with the seminal figures of the Beat poetry and jazz scene in New York and the psychedelic sixties in San Francisco, and the seeker's journey that led him to encounters with Ram Dass, Elisabeth K�bler-Ross and the Dalai Lama.</p><p>In this intimate account of compassion and healing, Levine's narrative turns progressively inward as he describes his life's path toward a deeper understanding of "the way of things." A former drug addict become spiritual teacher, Levine describes how he learned to use his life as a jumping-off point from which to teach healing principles and guided meditations. The author lays bare his own understanding of mindfulness, loving kindness, and service (the fundamental pillars of Buddhism) in an account of a life rich with characters immediately recognizable as leaders of the modern Eastern spirituality movement. Levine, through his life and work, embodies the message that personal peace and transcendence are possible for all.</p></p><p>"I was born a hungry ghost," is the opening line of renowned Buddhist teacher Stephen Levine's memoir <i>Turning Toward the Mystery</i>. By the time Levine was 2 years old he was starving to death because of a doctor's bungled attempt to treat a digestive problem in infancy. This early starvation prepared Levine for stealing candy bars at age 4, toting a gun in his teenage years, and eventually turning his hunger toward the sacred journey into the unknown--that which he calls the mystery. When the drama of Levine's life story (heroin addiction, a stint at Riker's Island penitentiary for drug possession) falls away, we are left with the universal story of human longing. In this way Levine continues to be a teacher, using his life story to speak to the <i>constant desire</i> that feeds addictions, materialism, envy, and self-pity, to name a few collective demons. "The more we want food, love, sex, courage, the greater the feeling of not having them," he writes. "I saw desire as an undulating nausea in the pit of the hungry ghost's belly."<p>Levine, who has devoted much of his life work to the care of the dying (<i>A Year to Live</i>, <i>Who Dies?</i>), teaches the path of compassion, how suffering is caused by attachment, and how pleasure is the absence of desire. Because of his leanings toward poetry and Buddhism, Levine's writing is vivid, clean, and filled with lots of white space. The layering between personal story and spiritual teaching is well separated on the page, and yet the beauty of this memoir is that they unfold together so perfectly, not unlike the petal-by-petal opening of the lotus. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Stephen Levine is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on death and dying and the author of <em>Who Dies?</em></p></p><h2>The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley</h2><p>Journal entries share the naturalist&#39;s memories of childhood and the Great Depression, descriptions of archaeological digs, and observations on nature and fellow writers</p><p>Loren Eiseley's many works include <i>The Night Country</i>, <i>The Invisible Pyramid</i>, <i>The Firmament of Time</i>, and <i>All the Strange Hours</i>, all available in Bison Books editions.

With her late husband, Martin, she received the Caldecott Medal for <i>The Glorious Flight</i> and a Caldecott Honor for Nancy Willard's Newbery Medal-winning <i>A Visit to William Blake's Inn.</i> The Provensens have appeared on the <i>New York Times</i> list of the Ten Best Illustrated Books eight times -- the second most of any book illustrator. Alice Provensen lives on Maple Hill Farm in New York State.K-Gr 3-A distinguished illustrator uses the China she imagines as a setting for two philosophical fantasies. Though the stories are described as "legends from ancient China- retold," the CIP information is more accurate, categorizing the book as fiction rather than folklore. In the first story, a small boy from a village beset by bandits travels far to apprentice himself to a master swordsman. After two years of dodging talking objects like jugs and teapots, Little Chu learns to be attentive and alert, to anticipate danger. Master Li then presents him with his great sword and tells him to use it to chop cabbage. The bandits are so daunted by his skillful chopping of vegetables that they leave the village in peace. The second story concerns the conflict between a great painter and a greedy, cruel emperor. Commissioned to fill a huge, blank wall, the artist spends years painting a mural, knowing that the jealous emperor will kill him when he is finished. His solution to the problem, while echoing many Chinese stories about a picture coming to life, is not a traditional one. Although Provensen tells a good story in crisp, dramatic sentences, her stock characters engage in overly formal dialogue and have been placed in whimsical situations that exist only in the Western imagination. Her art pays respectful homage to Chinese narrative hand scrolls, and her sense of composition, color, and narrative flow are products of her distinguished career. Nonetheless, Emily Arnold McCully's Beautiful Warrior (Scholastic, 1998) and Molly Bang's Tye May and the Magic Brush (Morrow, 1992) are more authentic and accurate depictions of China.<p></p><p><i>Margaret A.

Step-by-step tying instructions for 500 flies, with sequential color photos. Includes fishing notes and chapters on techniques, tools, and materials.</p><p>Dave Hughes is a highly respected fly-fishing writer with more than two dozen books in print, including <i>Trout from Small Streams: 2nd Edition</i>, <i>Handbook of Hatches: 2nd Edition</i>, and <i>Trout Flies</i>. He lives in Portland, Oregon.It's tough to say that a flyfishing book at $75 is a "value," but Trout Flies may be an exception. Featuring over 1400 color photographs of fly patterns, this work should be a standard for those specializing in trout flies. Author of the well-regarded Wet Flies (LJ 2/15/95), Hughes has a style that is easygoing and conversational, and his patterns will leave the beginning or intermediate enthusiast with a good selection of flies that will be effective in most situations. This is a refreshing change from earlier flytying manuals, which often were dry and dogmatic. The entry for each pattern first provides a brief anecdote that summarizes the author's opinion of the fly and its uses, next provides the recipe and tying instructions, and finally gives some variations allowing several different flies to be tied while only one pattern is learned. Ted Leeson and Jim Schollmeyer (whose photographic talents Hughes acknowledges in his introduction) have a competing manual being published (The FlyTyer's Benchside Reference to Techniques and Dressing Styles, Frank Amato, 1998), and libraries may want to consider purchasing both works. Trout Flies is highly recommended for all flyfishing collections.?Jeff Grossman, Milwaukee Area Technical Coll.

Their flowing waters support an amazing diversity of insect species from all of the major orders -- in fact, at last count, Maine, alone, has 162 species of mayflies, the most of any state. Few, if any, books deal with the insects and life stages specific to New England, until now.Hatch Guide to New England Streams, by professional photographer and amateur entomology enthusiast Thomas Ames, explores the insects of New England. Ames covers: reading water; presentations for New England streams; tackle; night fishing; and more. The bulk of this book, however, deals with the insects and the best flies to imitate them. Similar in style to Jim Schollmeyer&#39;s successful Hatch Guide series, Ames discusses the natural and its behaviors on the left-hand page and the three best flies to imitate it on the right, including proper size and effective techniques. Tom&#39;s color photography of the naturals and their imitations is superb, making this book as beautiful as it is useful. A must for all New England fly-fishers!</p><p></p><h2>Standard of Honor (Templar Trilogy)</h2><p>A second installment in a trilogy that began with Knights of the Black and White finds young Battle of Hattin survivor Alexander Sinclair hiding his identity after the slaughter of his fellow Templars, while elderly Sir Henry St. Clair reluctantly serves King Richard during a Holy Land crusade.</p><p>Jack Whyte was born and raised in Scotland. He is the author of nine Arthurian novels set in Roman Britain, the Camulod series. Whyte&#39;s novels are also published in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Russia. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.<p><b>ONE</b></p><p>&#x201c;We should never have left La Safouri. In Christ&#x2019;s name, a blind man could see that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so? Then why didn&#x2019;t some blind man speak up and say so before we left? I&#x2019;m sure de Ridefort would have listened and paid heed, especially to a blind man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can shove your sarcasm up your arse, de Belin, I mean what I say. What are we doing here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re waiting to be told what to do. Waiting to die. That&#x2019;s what soldiers do, is it not?&#x201d;</p><p>Alexander Sinclair, knight of the Temple, listened to the quiet but intense argument behind him, but he took pains to appear oblivious to it, because even though a part of him agreed with what Sir Antoine de Lavisse was complaining about so bitterly, he could not afford to be seen to agree. That might be prejudicial to discipline. He pulled the scarf tighter around his face and stood up in his stirrups to scan the darkened encampment around them, hearing the muffled sounds of unseen movement everywhere and another, distant Arabic voice, part of the litany that had been going on all night, shouting &#x201c;Allahu Akbar,&#x201d; God is great. At his back, Lavisse was still muttering.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would any sane man leave a strong, secure position, with stone walls and all the fresh water his army might ever need, to march into the desert in the height of summer? And against an enemy who lives in that desert, swarms like locusts, and is immune to heat? Tell me, please, de Belin. I need to know the answer to that question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask me, then.&#x201d; De Belin&#x2019;s voice was taut with disgust and frustration. &#x201c;Go and ask de Ridefort, in God&#x2019;s name. He&#x2019;s the one who talked the idiot King into this and I&#x2019;ve no doubt he&#x2019;ll be glad to tell you why. And then he&#x2019;ll likely bind you to your saddle, blindfold you and send you out alone, bare-arsed, as an amusement offering to the Saracens.&#x201d;</p><p>Sinclair sucked his breath sharply. It was unjust to place the blame for their current predicament solely upon the shoulders of Gerard de Ridefort. The Grand Master of the Temple was too easy and too prominent a target. Besides, Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, needed to be goaded if he were ever to achieve anything. The man was a king in name only, crowned at the insistence of his doting wife, Sibylla, sister of the former king and now the legitimate Queen of Jerusalem. He was utterly feckless when it came to wielding power, congenitally weak and indecisive. The arguing men at Sinclair&#x2019;s back, however, had no interest in being judicious. They were merely complaining for the sake of complaining.</p><p>&#x201c;Sh! Watch out, here comes Moray.&#x201d;</p><p>Sinclair frowned into the darkness and turned his head slightly to where he could see his friend, Sir Lachlan Moray, approaching, mounted and ready for whatever the dawn might bring, even though there must be a full hour of night remaining. Sinclair was unsurprised, for from what he had already seen, no one had been able to sleep in the course of that awful, nerve-racking night. The sound of coughing was everywhere, the harsh, raw-throated barking of men starved for fresh air and choking in smoke. The Saracens swarming around and above them on the hillsides under the cover of darkness had set the brush up there ablaze in the middle of the night, and the stink of smoldering resinous thorn bushes had been growing ever stronger by the minute. Sinclair felt a threatening tickle in his own throat and forced himself to breathe shallowly, reflecting that ten years earlier, when he had first set foot in the Holy Land, he had never heard of such a creature as a Saracen. Now it was the most common word in use out here, describing all the faithful, zealous warriors of the Prophet Muhammad&#x2014;and more accurately of the Kurdish Sultan Saladin&#x2014;irrespective of their race. Saladin&#x2019;s empire was enormous, for he had combined the two great Muslim territories of Syria and Egypt, and his army was composed of all breeds of infidel, from the dark-faced Bedouins of Asia Minor to the mulattos and ebony Nubians of Egypt. But they all spoke Arabic and they were now all Saracens.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I see I&#x2019;m not alone in having slept well and dreamlessly.&#x201d; Moray had drawn alongside him and nudged his horse forward until he and Sinclair were sitting knee to knee, and now he stared upward into the darkness, following Sinclair&#x2019;s gaze to where the closer of the twin peaks known as the Horns of Hattin loomed above them. &#x201c;How long, think you, have we left to live?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not long, I fear, Lachlan. We may all be dead by noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You, too? I needed you to tell me something different there, my friend.&#x201d; Moray sighed. &#x201c;I would never have believed that so many men could die as the result of one arrogant braggart&#x2019;s folly ... one petty tyrant&#x2019;s folly and a king&#x2019;s gutlessness.&#x201d;</p><p>The city of Tiberias, the destination that they could have reached the night before, and the freshwater lake on which it stood, lay less than six miles ahead of them, but the governor of that city was Count Raymond of Tripoli, and Gerard de Ridefort, Master of the Temple, had decided months earlier that he detested Raymond, calling the man a Muslim turncoat, treacherous and untrustworthy.</p><p>In defiance of all logic in the matter of reaching safety and protecting his army, de Ridefort had decided the previous afternoon that he had no wish to arrive at Tiberias too soon. It was not born of a reluctance to meet Raymond of Tripoli again, for Raymond was here in camp, with the army, and his citadel in Tiberias was being defended by his wife, the lady Eschiva, in his absence. But whatever his reasons, de Ridefort had made his decision, and no one had dared gainsay him, since the majority of the army&#x2019;s knights were Templars. There was a well in the tiny village of Maskana, close to where they were at that moment, de Ridefort had pointed out to his fellow commanders, and so they would rest there overnight and push down towards Lake Tiberias in the morning.</p><p>Of course, Guy de Lusignan, as King of Jerusalem, could have vetoed de Ridefort&#x2019;s suggestion as soon as it was made, but, true to his vacillating nature, he had acceded to de Ridefort&#x2019;s demands, encouraged by Reynald de Chatillon, another formidable Templar and a sometime ally of the Master of the Temple. De Chatillon, a vicious and foresworn law unto himself and even more arrogant and autocratic than de Ridefort, was the castellan of the fortress of Kerak, known as the Crow&#x2019;s Castle, the most formidable fortress in the world, and he held the distinction of being the man whom Saladin, Sultan of Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia, hated most in all the Frankish armies.</p><p>And so the signal had been passed and the army of Jerusalem, the greatest single army ever assembled by the eighty-year-old kingdom, had stopped and made camp, while the legions of Saladin&#x2019;s vast army&#x2014;its cavalry alone outnumbered the Franks by ten to one&#x2014;almost completely encircled them. Hemmed in on all sides even before night fell, the Frankish army of twelve hundred knights, supported by ten thousand foot soldiers and some two thousand light cavalry, made an uncomfortable camp, dismayed and unnerved, alas too late, by the swift-breaking news that the well by which their leaders had chosen to stop was dry. No one had thought to check it in advance.</p><p>When a light breeze sprang up at nightfall they were grateful for the coolness it brought, but within the hour they were cursing it for blowing the smoke among them throughout the night.</p><p>Now the sky was growing pale with the first light of the approaching day, and Sinclair knew, deep in his gut, that the likelihood of him or any of his companions surviving the coming hours was slim at best. The odds against them were laughable.</p><p>The Temple Knights, whose motto was &#x201c;First to attack; last to retreat,&#x201d; loved to boast that a single Christian sword could rout a hundred enemies. That arrogant belief had led to an incredible slaughter of a large force of Templars and Hospitallers at Cresson, a month and some days earlier. Every man in the Christian force, except for the Master de Ridefort himself and four wounded, nameless knights, had gone down to death that day. But the army surrounding them this day would quickly put the lie to such vaunting nonsense, probably once and for all. Saladin&#x2019;s army was composed almost entirely of versatile, resilient light cavalry. Mounted on superbly agile Yemeni horses and lightly armored for speed, these warriors were armed with weapons of damascened steel and light, lethal lances with shafts made from reeds. Thoroughly trained in the tactics of swift attack and withdrawal, they operated in small, fast, highly mobile squadrons and were well organized, well led and disciplined. There were countless thousands of them, and they all spoke the same language, Arabic, which gave them an enormous advantage over the Franks, many of whom could not speak the language of the Christians fighting next to them.</p><p>Sinclair had known for months that the army Saladin had gathered for this Holy War&#x2014;the host that now surrounded the Frankish army&#x2014;contained contingents from Asia Minor, Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia, and he knew, too, that leadership of the various divisions of the army had been entrusted to Saladin&#x2019;s ferocious Kurdish allies, his elite troops. The mounted cavalry alone, according to rumor, numbered somewhere in the realm of fifteen thousand, and he had seen with his own eyes that the supporting host accompanying them was so vast it filled the horizon as it approached the Frankish camp, stretching as far as the eye could see. Sinclair had clearly heard the number of eighty thousand swords being passed from mouth to mouth among his own ranks. He believed the number to be closer to fifty thousand, but he gained no comfort from that.</p></p><h2>Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess</h2><p>This book is essentially a chess teaching machine.

While still an undergraduate, he started the innovative literary journal <i>Hound and Horn,</i> as well as the modernist Harvard Society for Contemporary Art&#x2014;forerunner of the Museum of Modern Art. He brought George Balanchine to the United States, and in service to the great choreographer&#x2019;s talent, persisted, against heavy odds, in creating both the New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet. Among much else, Kirstein helped create Lincoln Center in New York, and the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut; established the pathbreaking <i>Dance Index</i> and the country&#x2019;s first dance archives; and in some fifteen books proved himself a brilliant critic of art, photography, film, and dance. <br><br>But behind this remarkably accomplished and renowned public face lay a complex, contradictory, often tortured human being. Kirstein suffered for decades from bipolar disorder, which frequently strained his relationships with his family and friends, a circle that included many notables, from W. H. Auden to Nelson Rockefeller. And despite being married for more than fifty years to a woman whom he deeply loved, Kirstein had a wide range of homosexual relationships throughout the course of his life. <br><br>This stunning biography, filled with fascinating perceptions and incidents, is a major act of historical reclamation. Utilizing an enormous amount of previously unavailable primary sources, including Kirstein&#x2019;s untapped diaries, Martin Duberman has rendered accessible for the first time a towering figure of immense complexity and achievement.</p><p>Martin Duberman, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History at the City University of New York, is the author of some twenty books, including <i>Charles Francis Adams</i> (winner of the Bancroft Prize); <i>James Russell Lowell</i> (finalist for the National Book Award); <i>Paul Robeson</i> (winner of the George Freedley Memorial Award); <i>Left Out: The Politics of Exclusion, Essays 1964&#x2013;2002;</i> <i>Black Mountain: An Exploration in Community;</i> and <i>Cures: A Gay Man&#x2019;s Odyssey</i>. His recent novel, <i>Haymarket</i>, has been published in several languages. Duberman&#x2019;s play <i>In White America</i> won the Drama Desk Award. He lives in New York City.<b>Chapter One: Growing Up (1917&#x2013;1926)</b><br><br>When Rose Stein told her family in the summer of 1893 that she wished to marry Louis Kirstein, she met with instant and strenuous opposition. The Steins, after all, were among Rochester&#x2019;s most prominent Jewish families, partners in the flourishing Stein-Bloch men&#x2019;s clothing company, pillars of the community&#x2014;even if, but one generation back, their mother had been a wet nurse in Posen, Germany.[1]<br><br>Who was this Louis Kirstein? A nobody in their view, a large, coarse-looking man with limited education and income&#x2014;and even more limited prospects. He did currently hold down a salesman&#x2019;s job for an optical firm, but though admittedly bright, congenial, and ambitious, he hadn&#x2019;t found work that genuinely engaged him or offered promise of a secure future. Nor did his history inspire confidence that he ever would.<br><br>Alarming tales had reached the stodgy Stein clan: Kirstein, it seemed, had only a grammar-school education, had left home at sixteen, ridden the rails as a hobo, worked as a janitor in a St. Louis brothel, and once been held in jail overnight for trying to peddle a worthless patent medicine. He had, though still in his late twenties, already gone bankrupt three times&#x2014;once as part owner, player, and manager of a bush-league baseball team.<br><br>The words &#x201c;sporting type,&#x201d; &#x201c;maverick,&#x201d; and &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; clung to his name: he was said to like fine Cuban cigars (Corona Coronas) and well-tailored clothes, was a habitual (and lucky) poker player&#x2014;and wasn&#x2019;t an observant Jew. Not that the Steins were, either, but somehow Louis <i>should</i> have been, given his otherwise unorthodox ways. No, Rose was told, the match was entirely unsuitable.<br><br>But Rose refused to yield. She felt certain that the man she&#x2019;d fallen for couldn&#x2019;t be summarized by his hard-luck past, nor could his earlier missteps be taken as an accurate gauge of his character. The Louis Kirstein she knew was a charismatic man of integrity and generosity, a man of shrewd intelligence, unflagging optimism, and a tremendous appetite for life. Far from being a &#x201c;sporting type,&#x201d; he believed strongly in the ideal of &#x201c;service&#x201d;&#x2014;in using one&#x2019;s gifts and good fortune in behalf of those less fortunate. And, far from being a &#x201c;fancy man,&#x201d; he adhered to standard middle-class values of hard work, civic-mindedness, and devotion to family. No, she would not give him up. (Nor would she be at all surprised when, within a decade, Louis would begin a rapid ascent to wealth and influence.)<br><br>Rose&#x2019;s obstinacy was not an entire surprise to her family. Though she&#x2019;d grown up a conventional enough child, and was now seemingly content with the decorous confines of well-to-do womanhood&#x2014;a keen interest in fashion, embroidery and lace, museumgoing, the arts and concerts&#x2014;her six siblings had been warned at an early age, so one of them later remembered, &#x201c;never to cross Rosie because she might have one of her crazy tantrums.&#x201d; Her daughter Mina would later write of her, &#x201c;She was not given to revealing her feelings, only exploding when they were injured.&#x201d;<br><br>Ultimately Rose&#x2019;s parents gave their reluctant consent to an engagement. But they stipulated that marriage could not take place for three years, during which time they confidently expected their daughter to change her mind. She didn&#x2019;t. When the three-year waiting period was up, in January 1896, she and Louis quietly wed&#x2014;and promptly moved to Boston. This further aggravated family disapproval. Rose&#x2019;s parents didn&#x2019;t cut her off, but when she gave birth to her first child, Mina, a year later, it was not her own mother who came down from Rochester to stand by but rather Louis&#x2019;s widowed mother.<br><br>Once settled in a modest rented apartment, Louis went to work for the well-established opticians Andrew J. Lloyd &amp; Company, and began to spend considerable time on the road selling eyeglasses. His own father, Edward, had been a lens grinder in Jena, near Leipzig, a city that for a time had been a center of liberal thought and home to Fichte, Hegel, and Schiller. Edward and his wife, Jeanette, had been adherents of the revolutionary uprising of 1848, and in the wake of its failure, had fled Germany, along with hordes of like-minded social radicals, for the United States. There Edward had found work with the Bausch and Lomb optical company in Rochester, the same city where, some dozen years later, Rose&#x2019;s father, Nathan Stein, became a wealthy man&#x2014;thanks to contracts he secured during the Civil War to make uniforms for the Union army (uniforms, it was widely rumored, that were cut from shoddy material).<br>The Steins&#x2019; ongoing condescension to Louis dissipated somewhat with the birth of Mina, in 1897; to them it apparently signified seriousness and permanence. The renegade couple was invited to return to Rochester, and Louis offered employment with the family company, Stein-Bloch. He took his time accepting: the Steins had treated him as unworthy, and Louis had a settled sense of self-regard.<br><br>Still, he missed his mother, who&#x2019;d remained in Rochester, living modestly in a small gray frame house in a decaying section of the city. Kindhearted, politically liberal, courageous (she was crippled with arthritis but never complained), and cultivated&#x2014;her special passions were Goethe and Heine&#x2014;Grandma Kirstein was the only religious member of the family; she read the Old Testament in German, prayer books in Hebrew, and insisted that Louis attend synagogue on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Despite her limited means, Grandma Kirstein (who died in 1914) would treat visitors to a spread of marzipan, pretzels, <i>Apfelstrudel</i>, and licorice sticks. Should Louis be in town, his favorite preserve, quince jelly, would be served, and should Mina accompany him, Grandma made her favorite&#x2014;<i>K�chelchen</i>, little drops of sponge cake dipped in fat.<br><br>An additional reason for returning to Rochester was that Rose also missed her family, and especially two of her sisters, Molly and Jane. (She felt less close to her other siblings, and downright distant from her two difficult, somewhat showy bachelor brothers, one of whom summered in a palatial &#x201c;cottage&#x201d; and the other notoriously &#x201c;not nice&#x201d; to his female help.)<br>In 1901 the Kirsteins finally decided to return to Rochester, and Louis accepted a job with Stein-Bloch as a traveling salesman. They moved into a modest-size house on Portsmouth Terrace, around the corner from Rochester&#x2019;s most elegant street, East Avenue, which boasted the pillared mansion of George Eastman, inventor of the box Kodak camera. Louis had once worked for Eastman and became a personal acquaintance; it was rumored that he&#x2019;d rejected Eastman&#x2019;s offer to join the Kodak firm, convinced that the new &#x201c;toy&#x201d; was a passing fad.<br><br>The Kirsteins&#x2019; house was securely nestled within a cluster of Stein homes. Rose&#x2019;s widowed sister, Molly, lived next door with her daughter; sister Jane lived two houses down the street with her husband, Martin Wolff, owner of Rochester&#x2019;s prestigious Lyceum Theatre, and their two children. Young Mina Kirstein soon decided that her favorite neighbors were not her relatives but the firemen who lived around the corner, fed her pears from the tree, and lifted her up to pat the heads of their beautiful white horses.<br><br>Rose managed to give the interior of their home some distinction through a generous sprinkling of potted palms, large ferns, and a number of marble statues&#x2014;a near life-size <i>Fisher Boy</i>, the bust of a Gypsy atop a twisted green marble pillar, and in the sitting room, a small <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>. She bought a big Morris chair for Louis, stocked the bookshelves (Rose was herself a devoted reader), and provided Mina, who&#x2019;d early been labeled &#x201c;precocious&#x201d;&#x2014;at seven she was reading Shaw&#x2019;s <i>You Never Can Tell</i>&#x2014;with piano lessons, dancing school, a governess who spoke both French and German, and clothes imported from the fashionable New York stores Best and Peter Thompson.<br><br>Both of Rose&#x2019;s bachelor brothers, and a brother-in-law as well, worked in the Stein-Bloch business. Nathan Stein, the quick-tempered family patriarch, required (until his death in 1908) that all family members attend him daily at lunch in his impressive Gibbs Street brick mansion, with its ornate mirrors, cut-glass vases filled with fresh American Beauty roses, superb Belter rosewood chairs&#x2014;and <i>two</i> servants on duty behind his chair to prevent his ever being kept waiting. After lunch the men would retire for a game of billiards&#x2014;which Nathan somehow always won. Though a considerable despot, he had a soft spot for his grandchildren, and Mina seems to have been a favorite. As an adult she would remember him as having been &#x201c;very kind&#x201d; to her, sending her off every Saturday for a shampoo and manicure with a Mrs. Davenport (whom Mina, later in life, suspected had been Grandpa Stein&#x2019;s &#x201c;special friend&#x201d;).<br>Rose Kirstein gave birth to a second child, a boy, on May 4, 1907, and Louis (who was forty-one at the time of his son&#x2019;s birth) named the baby Lincoln in honor of his idol, Abraham Lincoln. Ten-year-old Mina&#x2019;s reaction was less benign. &#x201c;He looks like a lobster!&#x201d; she screamed on first seeing him&#x2014;and Rose promptly ordered her from the bedroom, into the arms of her comforting father. The two loved each other deeply, and Louis reassured Mina that her special place in his heart was inviolable. The essential family alliances, never rigid, had been formed: father and daughter, mother and son.<br><br>Mina quickly came round about the new baby, however and on the nurse&#x2019;s day off, took to wheeling the infant, whom she now declared &#x201c;ravishingly beautiful,&#x201d; along the street...</p><h2>The Blue Book of the John Birch Society</h2><p>The Blue Book of the John Birch Society by Robert Welch.</p><p></p><h2>The Rustlers of West Fork: A Hopalong Cassidy Novel (The Louis L&#39;Amour Collection.)</h2><p>In this first of four classic frontier novels, Louis L'Amour adds his own special brand to the life and adventures of one of America's favorite fictional cowboys, Hopalong Cassidy.

During these casual sessions they recorded more than 100 songs, some originals, but most borrowed from barely remembered folk, blues, and country musicians. <p> This music they derived from had been part of the American fabric in an anonymous way that can only be explained as folklore and myth, and they breathed new life into it while adhering to its legacy. Though never intended for release, these recordings molded into the tradition of music as oral history, and appropriately, a few tapes were passed hand to hand, then some were pressed as bootleg records, which then spread like rumors. This folk revival conjured up a collection of timeless stories that many had heard in a slightly different form without ever knowing who started them. Just as Dylan did with the <i>Basement Tapes,</i> Marcus's exhilarating book extends beyond music and into the psyche of America, making the present more clear by putting the past into focus.</p>Greil Marcus is the author of Lipstick Traces, Mystery Train, and most recently Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus, Writings 1968-2010 (PublicAffairs, 2010).

He lives in the mountains of northern California.Grade 4-6-"The year is 1870, just a few months after laborers complete the transcontinental railroad....New routes require more equipment, and factories are turning out a locomotive every two days." Weitzman offers finely crafted black-and-white drawings in pen and ink and pencil to illustrate the two busy days factory workers spend manufacturing a "wood-burning 4-4-0, an eight-wheeler made for rapid passenger service." The handsome picture book begins with a double-spread diagram labeling 70 different parts of the locomotive followed by an engaging commentary on trains and railroading in the 19th century. This leads into a discussion of the factory itself and how the equipment was used. Descriptions of how each unit of the train was made become a bit dry and technical, and many pages go by before readers actually see a locomotive. The striking black-and-white presentation of historical manufacturing is reminiscent of earlier books by Edwin Tunis and Leonard Everett Fisher; this volume would pair nicely with Fisher's The Railroads (Holiday, 1979; o.p.), which covers the broader context. The human work and craftsmanship involved are well conveyed. The book will be enjoyed most by readers with a strong mechanical bent. Libraries may also find uses for it as a source on the Industrial Age as well as on railroad history.<br><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony</h2><p>The chairman of the Sony Corporation discusses the rise of Sony, his extraordinary career as a businessman, and his views on the United States, Japan, and the world economy</p><p>Cofounder and chairman of Sony Corporation, Morita, who personifies Japan's postwar technological ascendancy, ascribes his interest in electronics to his mother's love of Victrola recordings of European music. With the help of Time magazine's Tokyo bureau-chief Reingold and Japanese journalist Shimomura, he traces the development of his multinational firm, starting with a primitive tape recorder he built amid Tokyo's wartime rubble. Determined to change the image of Japanese goods to one of quality in foreign markets, especially in the U.S. where he established a subsidiary, he was gratified that Sony products were soon copied by global competitors. While retaining the mental discipline of his native education, Morita has adopted features of the Western world. He contrasts the Japanese familial, long-term concept of employee relations and other business practices with those of the U.S., which he criticizes for its litigious, hasty and often uncompromising attitudes. Liberalization of trade on both sides, he avers, would be a positive step in solving the worldwide economic crisis.

Of special interest to managers will be Morita's chapter "On Management," which unlocks some of the issues he believes to account for Japanese economic success. Items of discussion here include the Japanese philosophies of lifetime employment, job rotation, long-run orientation, and quality control.

Perfection is in the detail: decorative seams, exquisite stitching, knife sharp pleats and voluptuous drapery feature alongside more usual techniques such as stamping, pinking and slashing. Many of the skills displayed have been lost to the modern world: such labour-intensive handwork is no longer done and these effects cannot be replicated by machine. Yet many fashion designers take their inspiration from the past, adapting ideas to a more contemporary idiom.

Her portraits, in stark black and white, seemed to reveal the psychological truths of their subjects. But after she committed suicide in 1971, at the age of forty-eight, the presumed chaos and darkness of her own inner life became, for many viewers, inextricable from her work.</p><p>In the spirit of Janet Malcolm's classic examination of Sylvia Plath, <i>The Silent Woman,</i> William Todd Schultz's <i>An Emergency in Slow Motion</i> reveals the creative and personal struggles of Diane Arbus. Schultz veers from traditional biography to interpret Arbus's life through the prism of four central mysteries: her outcast affinity, her sexuality, the secrets she kept and shared, and her suicide. He seeks not to diagnose Arbus, but to discern some of the private motives behind her public works and acts. In this approach, Schultz not only goes deeper into Arbus's life than any previous writer, but provides a template with which to think about the creative life in general.</p><p>Schultz's careful analysis is informed, in part, by the recent release of some of Arbus's writing and work by her estate, as well as by interviews with Arbus's psychotherapist. <i>An Emergency in Slow Motion</i> combines new revelations and breathtaking insights into a must-read psychobiography about a monumental artist-the first new look at Arbus in twenty-five years.</p></p><p><b>William Todd Schultz </b>is a professor of psychology at Pacific University in Oregon, focusing on personality research and psychobiography.

His own book in the series, <i>Tiny Terror,</i> examines the life of Truman Capote. Todd Schultz blogs for <i>Psychology Today</i>."Absorbing analysis of [Arbus's] life...&nbsp;The book builds up to its final theory that Arbus's art served as an "accelerant" for her suicide. The dark nature of the work sucked her deeper into her personal abyss." --<b>The Independent</b><br><br>"Armed with interviews with her psychotherapist as well as autobiographical fragments, this new "psychobiography" sheds light on Arbus's opaque personality. Above all, [Schultz] shows how the photographer projected her inner torment and sense of estrangement onto her unsuspecting sitters." --<i><b>The Economist</b></i><br><br>"Schultz sifts and shapes his material with flair, working towards [Arbus's] death with all the planning of a good thriller. The temptation with any artist suicide, he warns us, is to find the "dark calculus" in their art. His triumph lies in making her suicide the one thing you don't see when you return to her images. -<b>The Telegraph</b><br><br>"Poignant and provocative,&nbsp;<b><i>An Emergency in Slow Motion</i></b>&nbsp;offers an entirely new way of relating to and understanding one of the most revered and influential postmodern photographers, in the process raising timeless and universal questions about otherness, the human condition, and the quest for making peace with the self." -<i><b>Brain Pickings</b></i><br><br>"Like her pictures, this dark inner life is not pretty... but it is discomfortingly enlightening." --<i><b>Shelf Awareness</b></i></p><h2>Warriors of Tibet: The Story of Aten and the Khampas&#39; Fight for the Freedom of their Country</h2><p>A heartfelt story of one man&#39;s struggle for Tibetan independence.

Ranging from the ancient world to World War II, from the war in Algeria (1954&#x2013; 62) to the torture of the IRA in Northern Ireland, from the torture of Native Americans to India, China, Japan and Cambodia&#x2019;s Killing Fields, the book also details the torture that has taken place since 9/11, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Guantanamo Bay.<br> Meticulously researched, <i>The History of Torture</i> is illustrated with more than 100 etchings, paintings and photographs.

Forged by the collaborative efforts of professional artists and local residents, this unique field brings performance together with a range of political, cultural, and social projects, such as community-organizing, cultural self-representation, and education.&nbsp;<i>Local Acts</i> presents a long-overdue survey of community-based performance from its early roots, through its flourishing during the politically-turbulent 1960s, to present-day popular culture. Drawing on nine case studies, including groups such as the African American Junebug Productions, the Appalachian Roadside Theater, and the Puerto Rican Teatro Pregones, Jan Cohen-Cruz provides detailed descriptions of performances and processes, first-person stories, and analysis. She shows how the ritual side of these endeavors reinforces a sense of community identification while the aesthetic side enables local residents to transgress cultural norms, to question group habits, and to incorporate a level of craft that makes the work accessible to individuals beyond any one community. The book concludes by exploring how community-based performance transcends even national boundaries, connecting the local United States with international theater and cultural movements.</p></p><p>Jan Cohen-Cruz is an associate professor of drama at New York University&#x2019;s Tisch School of the Arts, where she participated in the founding of the Center for Art and Public Policy.

A horse named Dr. Fager, a.k.a. "The Doc," got this reviewer hooked on the sport over 30 years ago. All of Doc's 22 lifetime starts and statistics were in the book: an impressive string of wins, a loss to Damascus, and four more consecutive wins culminating in a then record-breaking seven-furlong time. The list of champions is incredible; Domino, Sir Barton, Man O' War, Whirlaway, Sea Biscuit, Secretariat, Native Dancer, Gear, Sweep, and Affirmed are all at the reader's fingertips. Most impressive are the actual recorded data for turn-of-the-century winners that were campaigners. For instance, Roseben raced 111 from 1903 to 1909, having 52 wins and a total 89 times in the money. The public loved Roseben, who only earned $74,000 in prize money but set a record that took over 40 years to beat.

Their popularity has never waned, and in recent years their trade has enjoyed a world-wide revival. Beads have deep and multiple meanings: in many cultures, together with garments, they reflect age, gender and social status, and are a vehicle through which people store, exchange and transmit wealth.This absorbing book analyzes techniques and gendered aspects of the making of beads, as well as their role in trade and body adornment, in a wide range of societies, from the ancient Mediterranean to Renaissance Venice and present-day Southern Africa and West Africa, where they have become a symbol of cultural survival and identity.

Bringing together nearly 80 paintings, collages and objects with a selection of photographs, periodicals and early commercial work, it offers fresh insight into Magritte&#x2019;s identity as a modern artist and one of Surrealism&#x2019;s greatest painters. Beginning in 1926, when Magritte first aimed to create paintings that would, in his words, &#x201c;challenge the real world,&#x201d; and concluding in 1938--a historically and biographically significant moment just before the outbreak of World War II--the publication traces central strategies and themes from this seminal period, particularly those of displacement, isolation, transformation, metamorphosis, the &#x201c;misnaming&#x201d; of objects and the representation of visions seen in half-waking states. The publication also includes an illustrated chronology outlining significant moments in the artist&#x2019;s life during this period, including travel, connections with other Surrealist artists and writers, contributions to journals and important exhibitions and reviews.</p><p>This installation of the Modern Master series surveys the work of Rene Magritte, one of the most enigmatic artists of the 20th century and an important figure in the surrealist movement. He combined the commonplace with the fantastic to become the master of &#34;magic realism.&#34; Cloud-filled skies, bowler-hatted men, and oversized household objects are in abundance in the more than 60 full-color reproductions included in this volume.Rene Magritte was born RenE FranAois-Ghislain Magritte in 1898 in Belgium. In March of 1912, Magritte&#39;s mother killed herself by jumping into the river Sambre. The next year, the young artist met his future wife, Georgette Berger; the year after that he enrolled as a pupil at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. In the early 1920s, Magritte served in the military, married Georgette, and worked as a graphic artist, primarily drawing motifs for wallpaper. De Chirico provided a strong early influence. Magritte&#39;s first painting, a portrait of singer Evelyne BrElia, was sold in 1923, and his first surrealist work, Le Jockey Perdu, was painted in 1926. His first exhibition was held in 1927; soon thereafter, he and Georgette moved near Paris and began to meet other surrealists like MirU, Eluard and Arp. His relationships with the surrealists only deepened over the following years: Magritte published his work in various surrealist journals, vacationed with the DalIs, and exhibited with Edward James. At different points during his mature career, he dramatically changed his painting style, only to return to his original surrealist ways. Magritte died in 1967.</p><h2>Bead Embroidery (Essential Stitch Guides)</h2><p>The Royal School of Needlework (RSN) teaches hand embroidery to the highest standard and is well respected all over the world.

Tour.</p><p>Greg Bear is the author of more than thirty books, spanning the thriller, science fiction, and fantasy genres, including Blood Music, Eon, The Forge of God, Darwin&#x2019;s Radio, City at the End of Time, and Hull Zero Three. His books have won numerous international prizes, have been translated into more than twenty-two languages, and have sold millions of copies worldwide.A book-length amplification of the last pages of The Forge of God (1987). After Earth's destruction by the planet-eating machines of the Killers, the Benefactors--another group of aliens--create the Ship of the Law crewed by Earth survivors (it's the Law that victims of the machines must pursue vengeance). Martin, a young boy in the previous volume, now near-adult, is the Pan (i.e., leader--the rest of the crew are Lost Boys and Wendys). We see them drilling endlessly for the future skirmish and arguing over whether the mothers (Benefactor robots who maintain the ship) have told them everything they need to know to do the Job. They find several star systems that seem to be the Killers' home; they attack one and are repelled by an anti-matter counterattack, escaping only by a high- tech hairsbreadth. Then they continue to a second system, and are joined in their effort by a fascinating alien race who are aggregate intelligences braided of individual snakelike animal- level parts. Internal strife among the humans makes more difficult their task of penetrating the overwhelming technological superiority and deceptiveness of the Killers; but they ultimately destroy the entire system via a combination of superweapons and aggressive brute force, leaving the moral tone highly ambiguous. Lacking both the real-world anchoring of its predecessor and the transcendent ending it promises (finding a new home planet--a third volume?), and telling far more than it shows. Despite some interesting ideas, then: slow and unrewarding. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this book Richard Shweder presents its manifesto. Its central theme is that we have to understand the way persons, cultures, and natures make each other up. Its goal is to seek the mind indissociably embedded in the meanings and resonances that are both its product and its components.</p><p>Over the past thirty years the person as a category has disappeared from ethnography. Shweder aims to reverse this trend, focusing on the search for meaning and the creation of intentional worlds. He examines the prospect for a reconciliation of rationality and relativism and defines an intellectual agenda for cultural psychology.</p><p>What Shweder calls for is an exploration of the human mind, and of one's own mind, by thinking through the ideas and practices of other peoples and their cultures. He examines evidence of cross-cultural similarities and differences in mind, self, emotion, and morality with special reference to the cultural psychology of a traditional Hindu temple town in India, where he has done considerable work in comparative anthropology. And he critiques the concept of the "person" implicit in Western social science, as well as psychiatric theories of the "subject." He maintains that it will come as no surprise to cultural psychology if it should turn out that there are different psychological generalizations or "nomological networks"--a Hindu psychology, a Protestant psychology--appropriate for the different semiotic regions of the world. Shweder brings the news that God is alive not dead, but that there are many gods.</p></p><p>Richard A. Shweder, a cultural anthropologist, is the William Claude Reavis Professor of Human Development, University of Chicago.&#x201c;This welcome book opens new and challenging problems about the inseparability of mind and culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jerome Bruner</b></p><h2>The Wizard of Us: Transformational Lessons from Oz</h2><p>More than magic can be found in Oz...the wizard is <i>us</i>.<br><br>In <i>The Wizard of Us</i>, discover the powerful, unique skills and qualities of Dorothy, the Wizard, and the other archetypes of mind, heart, and courage that live within each of us.

In <i>The Murder of Jesus</i>, John MacArthur presents this pivotal moment in the life of Jesus in a way that forces readers to witness this event in all its power. The passion of Christ is examined chronologically through the lens of the New Testament with special attention given to Jesus' words on the cross, the miracle that attended the cruxifixion, and the significance of Christ's atoning work.</p></p><p>While history is overrun with stories of injustice that stir us to anger and outrage, the death of Jesus has become so familiar that often it fails to elicit such a response. In <i>The Murder of Jesus</i>, John MacArthur (<i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i>) writes that the crucifixion of Jesus "was the greatest travesty of justice the world will ever see... He was cruelly executed by men who openly acknowledged His faultlessness." At the same time, however, His death was purposed by God to secure salvation for sinners.<p> In this historical narrative, MacArthur gives a complete biblical account of the events leading up to and including Jesus' crucifixion. This chronological examination includes a detailed look at everything from Judas's betrayal to Peter's denial to Christ's final words on the cross and the significance of His atoning work. In the midst of the drama, MacArthur draws out personal points in regard to handling unjust suffering, as well as examples of the disciples' faulty faith. MacArthur's most poignant question, however, asks the reader to investigate who is responsible for Jesus' death. The answer might surprise you even while it elevates you to a new level of doctrinal maturity by shedding light on God's sovereignty during the most devilish murder in history. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i></p>John MacArthur has served as the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, since 1969.

Robert Sullivan went to a disused, garbage-filled little alley in lower Manhattan to contemplate the city and its lesser-known inhabitants-by observing the rat.</p><p>Rats live in the world precisely where humans do; they survive on the effluvia of human society; they eat our garbage. While dispensing gruesomely fascinating rat facts and strangely entertaining rat-stories-everyone has one, it turns out-Sullivan gets to know not just the beast but its friends and foes: the exterminators, the sanitation workers, the agitators and activists who have played their part in the centuries-old war between human city dweller and wild city rat. With a notebook and night-vision gear, he sits nightly in the streamlike flow of garbage and searches for fabled rat-kings, sets out to trap a rat, and eventually travels to the Midwest to learn about rats in Chicago, Milwaukee, and other cities of America. With tales of rat fights in the Gangs of New York era and stories of Harlem rent strike leaders who used rats to win tenants basic rights, Sullivan looks deeper and deeper into the largely unrecorded history of the city and its masses-its herd-of-rats-like mob. Funny, wise, sometimes disgusting but always compulsively readable, Rats earns its unlikely place alongside the great classics of nature writing.</p><p><b>Did you know?</b></p><p>- 26% of all electric cable breaks and 18% of all phone cable disruptions are caused by rats, 25% of all fires of unknown origin are rat-caused, and rats destroy an estimated 1/3 of the world's food supply each year. The rat has been called the world's most destructive mammal-other than man.</p><p>- Male and female rats may have sex twenty times a day. A female can produce up to twelve litters of twenty rats a year: one pair of rats has the potential for 15,000 descendants in a year.</p></p><p>In his third book, Robert Sullivan leaves the wilds of the (<i>Meadowlands</i> and the rough whaling waters of the Pacific Northwest to take up rat-watching in the alleys of New York City. Sullivan learned to appreciate the rodents during nocturnal stakeouts; a night-vision scope helped him observe rats without scaring them. As in his previous books, Sullivan uses pointillist details rather than broad portraiture to paint his subject, and the details in <i>Rats</i> are devilish. There are plenty of facts in the book to make your skin crawl, such as a description of the greasy skids rats leave on the paths they frequent, and a list of garbage items they prefer to eat. But Sullivan's style is often less that of a nature writer than a historian. In personable, essayish chapters, New York's history is revealed to be particularly ratty, with tall tales about the rodents' disgusting accomplishments going back to the city's founding. Although many people have never seen a rat outside a pet store, Sullivan reminds us that they are our constant neighbors, staring out from dim corners and messy crevices with beady eyes and twitching whiskers. <i>--Adam Fisher</i><p>Praise for author Robert Sullivan:</p><p>"A troubadour of urban borders, Robert Sullivan explores territory where no one wants to go."<br>-<i>Village Voice</i></p></p><h2>The Castle of the Pearl</h2><p>First published in 1983, this book has attracted a cult following.

He can't pay attention, he can't follow the rules, and he can't help it -- especially when his meds aren't working. Joey's had problems ever since he was born, problems just like his dad and grandma have. And whether he's wreaking havoc on a class trip or swallowing his house key, Joey's problems are getting worse. In fact, his behavior is so off the wall that his teachers are threatening to send him to the special-ed center downtown.</p><p>Joey knows he's really a <em>good</em> kid, but no matter how hard he tries to do the right thing, something always seems to go wrong. Will he ever get anything right?</p></p><p>Joey Pigza has problems. Big problems. He was emotionally abused by his grandmother. He has never met his dad. He can't get along in his elementary school classroom because of his mood swings and his "dud meds." We gradually see that Joey must have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), which is not being effectively controlled with his current medication. Joey's life is a terrifying roller-coaster ride, and Jack Gantos, author of the Rotten Ralph books, drags the reader along to see what life is like with ADD. The story is written from the boy's point of view in a sharp, worried style that veers out of control when Joey does. Joey's control of his own behavior slips away as we read, horrified to see this boy trying to get a grip on his life and failing. He disrupts the class field trip; he puts his finger in a pencil sharpener and injures himself; he swallows his house key. Then he runs through the classroom holding open sharp scissors. When he trips and falls, seriously injuring a classmate, he is transferred to a special-education program in another school. Here, thankfully, he encounters a caring teacher who recommends further medical evaluation, and Joey is eventually able to return to his former school. There is hope for Joey on the last page--he sits in the Big Quiet Chair to read. Gantos has achieved an unusual feat with this book. We want to turn away from Joey's shifting prison of emotions. But for those who stick with him, he shows us what his life is like. We walk a mile in his shoes, our feet hurting all the way. For young readers touched by ADD--and for their teachers and parents--Joey gives us the key to his world.

The lives of two streetwise teenage friends, Tetsuo and Kaneda, change forever when dormant paranormal abilities begin to waken in Tetsuo, who becomes a target for a shadowy government agency who will stop at nothing to prevent another catastrophe like that which leveled Tokyo. At the core of their motivation is a raw, all-consuming fear of an unthinkable, monstrous power known only as...Akira.</p><p></p><h2>Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban Adult Version</h2><p>Harry Potter, along with his friends, Ron and Hermione, is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry can&#39;t wait to get back to school after the summer holidays. (Who wouldn&#39;t if they lived with the Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense. There&#39;s an escape</p><p>For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Read by Jim Dale<br>Running time: 11 hrs., 48 mins. 10 CDs. <br>For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</p><h2>The Christian Home</h2><p>Everyone needs three homes. We receive a heavenly home when we come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Saviour. We need a church home where God&#39;s Word is preached and taught in the power of the Holy Spirit. We also need a Christian home where Christ is honored and the Christian life is lived on a daily basis.

But third grade, I was one of the class artists.</p><p>That's when I started reading comic books, especialy the Marvel superheroes created by Stan Lee. My sketchpads became full of The Fantastic Four, Spider-man, The Mighty Thor, and X-Men. Comic books were also my first introduction to dynamic storytelling. Nothing's more dramatic than colossal struggles between good and evil with entire galaxies at stake!</p><p>This enthusiasm led directly to Classic Comics, simplified versions of fantasy masterpieces like Jules Verne's <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em> and H.G. Wells' <em>The War of the Worlds.</em> It wasn't long before I became an avid reader, willing to tackle the work of Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and A.E. van Vogt.</p><p>During high school I became interested in the performing arts as well as the visual When I couldn't afford more than one semester of college, I signed up for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College. After training for two months, I clowned with Ringling for two seasons (1973-74), then performed with the country's largest tent show, Circus Vargas, in 1975. </p><p>After the circus, I was hired by my future wife, Donna, to perform with a puppet theatre. We married in 1976 and started our own company, Clarion Shadow Theatre, in 1980. Shadow puppetry was our specialty, wherein flat, jointed figures move against a screen illuminated with rear-projected scenery. Although I didn't know it at the time, shadow puppetry trained me to do picture books. Cutting out shadow puppets and projected scenery taught me how to use an X-Acto knife. The shadow screen was the same shape as an open book. Adapting legends and folktales into scripts taught me how to write. </p><p>When our chidren - Ariana and Alexander - were born, touring became impossible, so I adapted my cutting skills to illustration. After four years of freelancing for newspapers and magazines, I created my first picture book. <em>The Warrior and the Wise Man</em> (1989) looks very much like a shadow puppet play.</p><p>My cut-paper style matured with ensuing books. I learned to construct more detailed people and scenery, plus how to layer the artwork, creating the shadows that give depth to the pages. Happily, my books have been well received, culminating in the 1997 Caldecott Medal for <em>Golem.</em> </p><p>After six epic adventures, I wanted to try something comedic that would draw on my circus and puppet theatre experience. <em>The Secret Knowledge of Grown-ups</em> was the result, a silly conspiracy spoof about the real reasons why parents tell kids to do things. </p>A mesmerizing picture book for older readers, this story unfolds in a perfect blend of text and illustration. The Hidden Folk of frost and fire guide a Viking ship of settlers to a safe harbor, but deter a warrior ship from landing there. In anger, the warrior leader, Gorm the Grim, pronounces a curse on the peaceful Anlaf and his kin, causing Anlaf's daughter to be born blind. The child Elfwyn grows happily under the protection of the Hidden Folk, learning to use her other senses to make up for her blindness. In Trojan Horse fashion, Gorm presents Anlaf with a gift, a huge crystal in which all see a reflection of themselves in some unattainable position--younger, prettier, wealthier. The crystal causes discontent in all except Elfwyn, whose blindness makes her immune to its evil. When the others neglect their duties to continue gazing into the crystal, Elfwyn uses her pony to topple it. The splinters pursue her until she is rescued by the Hidden Folk, regaining her sight when the splinters crash into a boulder, thus ending the curse. This powerful story is based on elements of legend and history of the settlement of Iceland that are discussed in an extensive author's note at the end. Wisniewski's distinctive cut-paper illustrations are exquisitely rendered in rich and glowing colors. His portrayal of the people is especially compelling, with details of facial expression reflecting character and plot development. A truly original offering that will give back to today's children some of the mythic element that Joseph Campbell said we are missing. --Connie C.

Looking primarily at pulp novels and films, Slotkin takes a painstakingly thorough look at the relationship between imagery of the West in industrial mass culture and U.S. foreign policy during the 20th century. Specifically, he looks at how the previous century's "frontier aristocrat" served as the model diplomat for America's agenda of economic imperialism from the Spanish American War to the "police action" in Vietnam.<p> As the U.S. gained international stature, the archetype of the frontier aristocrat articulated the goals and ideals of the American populace. But Slotkin shows how, as time progressed, the increasing irrelevance of the frontier myth on foreign soil foiled the prowess of the U.S. war machine. At the book's conclusion, in which images of the My Lai Massacre are juxtaposed against the final shootout of Sam Peckinpah's <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, the contradiction between faith and experience becomes painfully evident. <i>Gunfighter Nation</i> delivers the satisfaction of a historian with the acquired wisdom to address directly the issues that inspired his lifelong work. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>The concluding volume of Richard Slotkin&#39;s highly acclaimed trilogy draws on a wide range of sources to examine the pervasive influence of Wild West myths on American culture and politics.</p><h2>Making Love Potions: 64 All-Natural Recipes for Irresistible Herbal Aphrodisiacs</h2><p>Herbs are hot!

Her wealthy friend Marsha's family traditionally has a special celebration for eleventh birthdays, and Marsha is planning a skating party with boys. Collette is sure that the party will be a total disaster, especially with snobbish cousin Carole advising Marsha on how to present a real teenage appearance. Adult characters are weak, especially Marsha's flighty mother, but there is a good feeling for the ambiguity of middle-grade social relationships. Collette's self-doubts and Marsha's somewhat frantic excesses provide a humorous contrast that will strike a realistic chord among young readers. --Elaine E.

The book opens with a brief introduction to the ancient art of kiting in East Asia, focusing on a description of seven popular styles of Japanese kites and the traditional materials used in their construction. Eubel outlines the concept and details of the intriguing project, involving risk and thrill, along with the recommended maximum size of each kite (580 cm 230 cm) in sample letters to several of the artists in this invitation-only event. The heart and soul of the catalog includes photographs of all the kites entered by the 100 world-class modern artists, including Appel, Imai, Kushner, Rauschenberg, Schumacher, Stella, Vasarely, and Wasselmann.

You can only have an Axe if you're a Northern Barbarian, a Dwarf, or a Blacksmith.

Why doesn't the economy collapse when pirates and bandits are so active and there is no perceptible industry?</p><p> <i>The Tough Guide to Fantasyland</i> (U.K. Edition) was a 1997 Hugo and World Fantasy Award nominee.

The first major work of nonfiction by the author of such classics as <em>Love Medicine</em> and The <em>Plague of Doves, The Blue Jay&#x2019;s Dance</em> is, in the words of the&nbsp;<em>New York Times Book Review,</em>&nbsp;an &#x201c;observant, tender, and honest&#x201d; meditation on the experience of motherhood. </p></p><p>Mothers often cling to single moments, small gestures, and specific memories in order to grasp all that happens in the first blurry year of a baby's life. In <i>The Blue Jay's Dance</i>, writer Louise Erdrich has assembled a photo album of snapshots such as these: the days and images that collectively define the passion, ambivalence, yearnings, and satisfactions of carrying, birthing, and nurturing a baby. "Any sublime effort has its dark moments," says Erdrich, referring to a rather bleak snapshot of mother isolation. "Perhaps, if anything, the meaning in this book for others may be this: Here is a job in which it is not unusual to be, at the same instant, wildly joyous and profoundly stressed." <i>The Blue Jay's Dance</i> is a fresh and masterful book that avoids all the sticky clich�s while still managing to articulate the depths of mother-baby love.<p>Louise Erdrich&#x2019;s first major work of nonfiction, <em>The Blue Jay&#x2019;s Dance</em>, brilliantly and poignantly examines the joys and frustrations, the compromises and insights, and the difficult struggles and profound emotional satisfactions the acclaimed author experienced in the course of one twelve&#x2013;month period&#x2014;from a winter pregnancy through a spring and summer of new motherhood to her return to writing in the fall.

Now you can put them to work in your paintings immediately!</p></p><p><p><b>Zoltan Szabo</b> was a well-known painter and watercolor instructor who taught workshops nationwide. He was among the first watercolor teachers to do so, and one of the first and most successful authors of watercolor instruction books. His previous North Light books include <i>Zoltan Szabo Watercolor Techniques</i> (1994); <i>Zoltan Szabo&#x2019;s Color-by-Color Guide to Watercolor</i> (1998); and <i>Watercolor Basics: Trees, Mountains and Rocks</i> (2000).</p>Szabo, a justly celebrated painter and teacher, is the author of seven previous books, including Painting Little Landscapes (Watson-Guptill, 1991). Szabo's early chapter on the qualities of transparent watercolor pigments is evidence of extensive experimentation. But his 65 years of painting watercolors and 30 years of teaching really pay off in the body of the book, where he shares many of the very specific techniques that can take decades to perfect. He doesn't merely do birch trees, he does ice on trees, frost on trees, rough tree bark, smooth tree bark, and trees in heavy snow. His chapter on reflections of light and color on a variety of wavy, choppy, and smooth water uses photographs and sketches to demystify this complicated subject. Similar books, like Ray Campbell Smith's Fresh Watercolour: Bring Light and Life to Your Painting (David &amp; Charles, 1995), are fine for the usual trees and foliage, skies, coastal scenes, and mountains. Szabo's book, with features like his sunlight on snow compared with sunlight on wood, advances art instruction to another level.

There is not even any foreshadowing of it in the 160 pages that precede Marion Schreiber's description of how a brave young Belgian Jew named Youra Livchitz began to orchestrate the surprise attack on a train carrying more than 1,600 men, women and children to the death camp at Auschwitz.</p><p>The fault, or explanation, appears to lie not with Schreiber but with her American publisher. The English title of its original German edition was Silent Rebels, which is a reasonably accurate description of what Schreiber has in fact done: portrayed the quiet but forceful and effective resistance, by ordinary Belgians, Jews and Christians alike, to four years of occupation by Nazi Germany. Silent Rebels is an appropriate title, but not an especially dramatic one. It is not difficult to imagine that Schreiber's American publisher decided that the way to find a niche for the book in this market was to tart it up as yet another variation on Schindler's List. Hence The Twentieth Train and its melodramatic subtitle.</p><p>Schreiber deserves better treatment than that. Her book is not without flaws, but it is an honest effort to depict a side of the war that is little known outside Belgium itself, a story that adds to our appreciation of the lengths to which unknown people went to save not merely themselves and their families but others to whom they had no obligations beyond those of common humanity. The mini-raid on the train to Auschwitz is part of that story, to be sure, and demands a place in this narrative, but many people who read the first two-thirds of The Twentieth Train will find themselves wondering if the train is ever going to arrive at the station, much less leave it.</p><p>All of which is by way of warning to the reader rather than commentary on the book Schreiber actually wrote. A former editor at Der Spiegel, the German equivalent of Time or Newsweek, she is a determined researcher and a competent if uninspired writer, though whether this is attributable to her or her translator is unclear. She was drawn to the subject when she met someone who had escaped the gas chambers by jumping off a train bound for Auschwitz. "Journalistic curiosity combined with admiration and respect for the wider Resistance movement in Belgium" inspired her to look into the story, and this book -- a panoramic overview of wartime Belgium, albeit focused on Brussels -- is the result. </p><p>By contrast with many other countries that came under Nazi occupation, Belgians mostly "rejected the brutal methods that the German occupying forces used against the Jews" and "proved to be largely immune to the poison of National Socialist racial hatred." Some 200,000 Belgians were active in the Resistance, which surely helps explain why "over 50 per cent, about 30,000 of the 56,000 Jews registered in Belgium, escaped the Holocaust," by contrast with a mere 12 percent next door in Holland. "Silent rebels" were everywhere:</p><p>"In all the city halls and council offices there were officials who quietly issued additional food cards for people's relatives who had supposedly been bombed out, or whose nieces had suddenly turned up out of the blue. There were city officials who gave the Resistance blank forms to which only the false name had to be added and the right passport photograph glued. And then there were postmen who intercepted letters addressed to the Gestapo and the war commands if they suspected they might contain denunciations. They opened the envelopes, warned the people denounced in them and delivered the letters two days late, to give them time to go into hiding. 'Service D' -- against defeatism and denunciation -- was the name that the members of this group gave themselves. They probably saved 5,000 people from being handed over to the occupying police."</p><p>It helped that Belgium's Queen Elisabeth bravely stayed in her home country (Holland's Wilhelmina escaped to London) and, in the words of one who spoke directly to her, was "deeply impressed by the despair of the Jewish population in the face of mass deportation." Her efforts to intercede on the Jews' behalf were cynically rebuffed by Adolph Hitler, but surely her example was an inspiration to her people. It helped, too, that the military governor of Belgium, Alexander von Falkenhausen, was a "picture-book Prussian aristocrat" who "held Hitler and his party comrades in profound contempt." Eventually pressure from Berlin wore him down, and he authorized the shooting of hostages, but he must have done so with the greatest reluctance. His deepest belief was that "law, justice and humanity stand over everything," and during most of his regime he was able to put principle into practice.</p><p>Others were considerably less admirable. Kurt Asche, "Adolph Eichmann's representative in Belgium," was a venal sybarite who held life-or-death power over Belgian citizens and imprisoned or executed many of them. A Polish Jew named Icek Glogowski betrayed numerous Jews to Asche: "As a spy and unofficial cop, 'le gros Jacques' helped to fill the trains to Auschwitz," as did Pierre Romanovitch, known as the "White Russian"; it was the latter who informed on the heroes of the train ambush and sent two of the three to their deaths. The Belgian Jewish Council wasn't much help, either. Its members were decent men, but they believed that they could fend off Nazi brutality "by being willing and compliant," and they also "saw armed resistance as being primarily the long arm of Soviet Communism." They gave the Resistance no encouragement and significant opposition.</p><p>Still, three men in their twenties managed to halt a train loaded with deportees in April 1943 as it made its way from "the picturesque little town of Mechelen in Flanders" to Auschwitz. Most of those aboard chose or were forced to stay (and in the end some of these actually survived the camp), but others were luckier: "In total, 231 deportees fled the convoy on 19 April 1943, before the German border. Twenty-three Jews died in the attempt, either under the hail of bullets from the sentries or by falling badly. Every escapee from the death train to Auschwitz could count on the help of the Belgian population. No one was betrayed. 'L'honneur des Belges.' " </p><p>It is neither exaggeration nor sentimentalization to say that Schreiber has told an inspiring story. What makes it so is far less the bold attack on the train than the steady courage, decency and humanity of those countless ordinary Belgians who refused to knuckle under. It's too bad that the book's American publisher failed to understand this, and is presenting The Twentieth Train as something it is not. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p>As authors and historians delve into the details of the Holocaust, they discover that the Nazi killing machine produced a long list of little-known heroes, and here Schreiber, a Brussels-based journalist and former editor at Der Spiegel, tells the tale of three such heroes. Armed with only three pairs of pliers, a hurricane lamp covered in red paper and a pistol, the Belgian resistance fighter Youra Livchitz and two friends conspired to pull off the unthinkable: on April 19, 1943, they ambushed a Nazi deportation train headed for Auschwitz and, under a spray of Nazi bullets, managed to free 17 men and women. Not long after, two of the ambushers were caught, tortured and ultimately met their deaths at the hands of a Nazi firing squad. Despite the title, only the last 50 pages or so actually deal with the fateful ambush, an account based on private documents, archival materials and interviews with surviving escapees. The remainder of the book is a detailed account of Brussels, a flourishing city before the war, and its transformation under the Nazi occupation. Although lengthy at times, this background provides a critical framework for the events that follow. Nazi resistance in Brussels, by Jews and gentiles alike, was an extraordinary display of humankindness and courage; such a spirit necessarily grew out of the liberal weltanschauung that had captured the prewar city's imagination. Schreiber's book is both moving and exciting - a celebration of good, rather than a reminder of evil.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taking readers to biblical sites not seen by Westerners for decades, Feiler's journey uncovers little-known details about the common roots of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and affirms the importance of the Bible in today's world.</p><p>In his intimate, accessible style, Feiler invites readers on a never-in-a-lifetime experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Israel</strong> Feiler takes a perilous helicopter dive over Jerusalem, treks through secret underground tunnels, and locates the spot where David toppled Goliath.</li><br><li><strong>Iraq</strong> After being airlifted into Baghdad, Feiler visits the Garden of Eden and the birthplace of Abraham, and makes a life-threatening trip to the rivers of Babylon.</li><br><li><strong>Iran</strong> Feiler explores the home of the Bible's first messiah and uncovers the secret burial place of Queen Esther.</li></ul><p>In <em>Where God Was Born</em>, Feiler discovers that at the birth of Western religion, all faiths drew from one another and were open to coexistence. Feiler's bold realization is that the Bible argues for interfaith harmony. It cannot be ceded to one side in the debate over values. Feiler urges moderates to take back the Bible and use its powerful voice as a beacon of shared ideals.</p><p>In his most ambitious work to date, Bruce Feiler has written a brave, uplifting story that stirs the deepest chords of our time. <em>Where God Was Born</em> offers a rare, universal vision of God that can inspire different faiths to an allegiance of hope.</p></p><p>Bruce Feiler's latest book combines now familiar elements into his own peculiar, delightful alchemy. Any particular page may be found effortlessly weaving together strands of theology, biblical exegesis, physical exploration, history and personal reflection as Feiler continues his journey of discovery, looking at the common roots of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. The Middle East has become a more dangerous place since the writing of his first book in this vein, <i>Walking the Bible</i>. But Feiler is impelled to answer his continued call, even when a flak jacket is necessary. He explores tunnels under Jerusalem. Goes to where David may have slain Goliath. Even looks for the Garden of Eden in Iraq while acknowledging that "the garden would never be found." It is this externalization of searches typically only made in the heart that fascinates us and brings power to Feiler's narrative. In one of the more compelling sections of the book, a meditation on Jonah, Feiler makes a persuasive argument that "God cares only that you conduct yourself in a moral way... And what might come across as preaching in another context is instead organic; Feiler's ideas seem to grow as much out of his travel and present-day experience as they do from Scripture and history. Of particular interest is his writing on King Cyrus II. He travels to Persepolis, in modern-day Iran, and finds an ancient precedent for religious tolerance in this king who helped the Jews build the Second Temple. Feiler provokes us to reflect that if the Bible itself can sing the praises of a king who accepted the various religions of those he ruled, perhaps there is hope we can find room for more tolerance in our own time.

It was the twenty-sixth year of Augustus Caesar&#x2019;s reign. I was nineteen and I&#x2019;d been put up for sale at the slave auction in Baiae after three months under Titus Atilius Bulbus, a fat, swarthy beast I was glad never to see again. I thanked the gods for the day Bulbus realized that a good cook was worth ten times his weight in denarii and decided it was more advantageous to sell me than to sleep with me.<br> <br>Midmorning, the slave master, a heavy man with a barrel-shaped torso supported by birdlike legs, shuffled me toward an empty pen at the end of the slave platform. He brought a stool so I didn&#x2019;t have to sit on the dusty ground as two haggard old women scrubbed my naked body until not a trace of grime lingered on my skin. They trimmed my hair and scraped off my beard, leaving me cleaner than I&#x2019;d been in months.<br> <br>From my bench in the new pen, I heard my future master before I saw him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Master Apicius,&#x201d; the slaver said in a simpering voice unlike the one with which he usually barked out commands at his slaves. &#x201c;I am glad you are here. I have two others inquiring about the cook. I hoped you would arrive first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; Apicius asked, his voice a smooth baritone.<br> <br>There was a rustle of tent flaps and the slap of sandals on the hot stones. I scrambled to my feet as they rounded the corner and came into view. Apicius looked about a decade older than me, with dark hair and an aquiline nose typical of a long Roman bloodline. An extraordinarily tall Egyptian with wick-black hair and biceps the size of ham hocks hovered in the background. I surmised that he was Apicius&#x2019;s body-slave&#x2014;the personal attendant who accompanied him everywhere.<br> <br>The slaver opened the door to the pen and yanked me out to stand in front of Apicius, who took appraisal of my naked body, noting with his eyes that my head was bare. &#x201c;No cap.&#x201d; He nodded his approval. The lack of a slave cap meant the fat slave master would guarantee me for six months. It also meant I was worth more.<br> <br>Apicius lifted the bronze plaque around my neck, freshly polished and etched with my credentials and history of ownership. I would wear it every day of my life as a slave. &#x201c;Free of illness. Does not steal. Good, good. Thrasius, eh? That&#x2019;s a Greek name.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded, unsure if I should speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were the coquus to Flavius Maximus?&#x201d; Apicius let go of the plaque and it slapped against my chest. &#x201c;Interesting. I dined with Maximus a few months before his death. We had sausages of pheasant, sweet melon relish, and a patina of small fry. Was that your doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>I gathered my courage and hoped my voice did not shake. I remembered that patina&#x2014;an egg custard of which Maximus was quite fond. &#x201c;Yes. The sweet melon relish was something new that I was trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long did you work for Maximus?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I ran his kitchen for a year before he died. He was fond of entertaining.&#x201d; My mind raced. Apicius was certainly interested in my cooking but what if this man was as cruel as Bulbus?<br> <br>Apicius raised an eyebrow at me. &#x201c;Can you make roasted peacock?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. I have a recipe for peacock with damson raisins soaked in myrtle wine. It works equally well with partridge or duck. I&#x2019;m sure you would find the dish to your liking.&#x201d; I wiped sweat off my brow.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you consider your specialty?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are three,&#x201d; I answered, raising my voice in order to be heard over the din of the market. &#x201c;My ham in pastry, with honey and figs, has often been praised, but I have been told it is equaled by my truffles with pepper, mint, and rue. I can also make you a dish of roasted salt belly pork with a special mixture of garum, cumin, and lovage.&#x201d;<br> <br>Apicius smiled and started to ask another question. But the slave master was growing impatient. &#x201c;The boy will make you famous,&#x201d; he whispered to Apicius. &#x201c;With him cooking, you will have clients and friends lining up in the morning, begging for a spot at one of your cenae!&#x201d; He paused. Apicius glowed.<br> <br>The slave master continued, &#x201c;His talents go beyond that of the kitchen. He can read and write, he is excellent at figures, and he speaks several languages. This is the coquus for you!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Famous?&#x201d;<br> <br>The slave master cocked his head and smiled. &#x201c;Most definitely.&#x201d;<br> <br>I expected Apicius to ignore the slaver&#x2019;s words. Yet he asked my price of the slave master and the answer shocked me. Twenty thousand denarii! Slaves rarely sold for more than a few hundred denarii.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sotas!&#x201d; Apicius beckoned to the body-slave. Disapproval briefly flashed across Sotas&#x2019;s features as he stepped forward with a bag.<br> <br>Apicius opened the bag to reveal several gold aurei, then laid the heavy pouch in the slaver&#x2019;s dark calloused hand. &#x201c;The argentarii know me well,&#x201d; he said, gesturing in the direction of two men standing under a small canopy at the corner of the slave market. As representatives of the Roman bank, the argentarii were responsible for officiating over the larger sales, verifying credit, and making sure transactions went smoothly. &#x201c;They will sign my letter of credit for the rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>The slave master grinned. He had profited heavily.<br> <br>I would later learn that my selling price was more than all the other slaves sold that morning combined.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>After the slave master had removed my shackles and thrown a threadbare tunic at me, Apicius motioned for me to follow. Sotas followed behind.<br> <br>As we made our way through the Baiae streets, I could sense unease in my new dominus. Perhaps he was having second thoughts about the high price he paid for me.<br> <br>When he spoke it was with impatience. &#x201c;Tonight I&#x2019;m having a small cena with a few close friends. Tell me what you will make for the meal.&#x201d;<br> <br>I faltered at my new master&#x2019;s words. I gazed up at the laundry lines strung between the insulae we walked past, with colorful stolae hanging out to dry. The sun was already past its apex.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am unsure of the staples in your kitchen.&#x201d; I kept my eyes down. My stomach churned as if I had eaten a rotten apple.<br> <br>Apicius stepped around a small group of boys playing a game of knucklebones. &#x201c;Never mind that. If you had any ingredient at your disposal, what would you make?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You said it was a small dinner?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he affirmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case, I would begin with a gustatio of salad with peppers and cucumbers, melon with mint, whole-meal bread, soft cheese, and honey cake.&#x201d; I tried to draw on my memory of one of the last meals I&#x2019;d made for Maximus.<br> <br>Apicius licked his lips. &#x201c;Yes, yes, go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then pomegranate ice to cleanse the palate, followed by a cena prima of saffron chickpeas, Parthian chicken, peppered morels in wine, mussels, and oysters. If I had more time, I would also serve a stuffed suckling pig. And to close, a pear patina, along with deep-fried honey fritters, snails, olives, and, if you have it on hand, some wine from Chios or Puglia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perfect. Simple and the flavors would blend nicely at the beginning of a meal. Good.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Apicius led us across the square to the altar to Fortuna Privata, the goddess of luck and wealth. I had been right in thinking my new master was worried about his purchase&#x2014;it was the only reason he would need to ask the goddess for a divination. On the way to the altar, we stopped at a grocer&#x2019;s stall to purchase offerings: a live goose, fruit, and honey cakes.<br> <br>The altar was between two buildings on top of a tall stone platform that housed a richly adorned statue of the goddess. Sotas handed the goose to Apicius, who brought it toward the priest waiting next to the altar. My heart pounded. This divination was about me, about how I would affect the Gavian household. An unlucky reading would place doubt in Apicius&#x2019;s mind, and the last thing I wanted was for Apicius to return me to that filthy slaver. He would beat me within an inch of my life for cheating him out of such a fortune. The gods only knew who I might end up with then&#x2014;the slaver might decide to send me to the salt mines, which would be a death sentence. Few slaves lasted more than a year or two cutting salt.<br> <br>The priest, a bald man with heavy-lidded eyes, wore red robes that, despite their color, could not hide the dark blood stains of his trade as a haruspex, one who gave divinations by viewing the entrails of sacrifices. Apicius handed the squawking goose to the priest, who sprinkled it with salted flour, poured a few drops of wine on its forehead, and said a blessing. He placed the goose in the copper bowl resting on a low side table and abruptly ended its cries with a quick slash across its neck and a push of the knife down its belly. Scarlet flooded the feathers and flowed into the bowl in a rush.<br> <br>There was no struggle, which bode well for the divination. The haruspex rolled the goose over and pushed upon it until the entrails fell into a viscous mess in the bowl. I observed my new master, wishing I knew what thoughts were going through his mind. An ironlike smell wafted up from the bowl.<br> <br>A few more cuts and the haruspex set the carcass into a second bowl off to the side. The goose meat was payment for his services. He pushed his hand through the goose guts, pulling aside intestines and organs. Last, the priest singled out the liver, heart, gizzard, and gall bladder. He turned each organ over in his hands, searching for spots and abnormalities by which he could discern the goddess&#x2019;s wishes. As a cook I had seen the insides of hundreds of geese, but I still didn&#x2019;t understand what a haruspex saw when he examined the blood and guts.<br> <br>After many long minutes, Apicius was unable to take the priest&#x2019;s silence any longer. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; he asked as he twisted the thick gold wedding ring around his finger.<br> <br>I was just as impatient. What if the divination said I was a terrible purchase? Would I be back on the slave block before the end of the afternoon?<br> <br>The haruspex cocked his head at Apicius, one eyebrow raised. I imagined he had seen the same look in the eyes of the wealthy before. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;The goddess Fortuna smiles upon you in some ways but, I fear, not in others.&#x201d;<br> <br>Apicius wiped his palms on the folds of his toga. I held my breath.<br> <br>The priest pushed around the entrails. He lifted up the liver. It was larger than normal but very smooth. &#x201c;In this I see a life of indulgence and prosperity. You will win many hearts and bring pleasure to many people. You will have much to love in your life.&#x201d; He examined the gall bladder. It was swollen and no longer green as it should be, but a bright, angry red.<br> <br>A whirring noise engulfed us as several hundred flapping pigeons swirled through the air. Apicius cursed. &#x201c;Damn pigeons.&#x201d; He glanced upward. &#x201c;Perhaps I should have sought an augur to read the birds instead of a gut gazer.&#x201d; I had to wonder as well; so many birds appearing at that moment must have great significance.<br> <br>The priest didn&#x2019;t look up. Apparently birds meant nothing to him unless they were sprawled open under his knife. He slashed the gall bladder open and pulled it apart with the tip of his blade. It was filled with hundreds of yellowish-orange pieces of gravel. He grimaced and my stomach lurched. What did he see?<br> <br>&#x201c;This is most unfortunate. A healthy liver and a rotten gall bladder. You will feel the blood of life mingling with the pang of death. Your good fortune will be as a disease throughout your life. The more you work toward success, the more your sky will darken.&#x201d; The haruspex jabbed a fat finger toward a particularly large rock glistening with bile. Two larger pebbles stuck to its sides. &#x201c;See that? Beware! For every success, greater failures will cluster to the sides.&#x201d;<br> <br>The priest ignored Apicius&#x2019;s sharp intake of breath. He put the gall bladder aside and turned to the rest of the entrails. He lifted the gizzard, a double-bulbed organ, and cut it open carefully, exposing a cavity full of grass, rocks, and other debris. &#x201c;Look here,&#x201d; he said, pointing to a piece of rounded pale blue glass amid the slimy debris. &#x201c;This means unusual judgment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Beads of sweat stood out on Apicius&#x2019;s brow.<br> <br>&#x201c;It means that, ultimately, you will be judged in the Underworld by how our world and the world of the future perceive you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The haruspex picked up the bowl and turned away.<br> <br>I felt sick&#x2014;it had been a dismal fortune and surely Apicius was bound to march me right back to the slave trader.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said Apicius, looking perplexed.<br> <br>The statue of Fortuna glowed in the early-afternoon sunlight. Her eyes, painted blue, stared at me.<br> <br>As he rose, Apicius repeated the priest&#x2019;s words over and over in a whisper: &#x201c;Judged in the Underworld by how the world sees me now and in the future.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced at Sotas, but the body-slave only bowed his head. I wished that I could ask Apicius what he intended. Would he send me back? I looked toward Fortuna and dared to stare into that aquamarine gaze. I thought back to my time with Bulbus and how he abused me in ways no person should have to endure. Please, my lady, grant me your favor. Please. Do not send me back to a beast like Bulbus. Please&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>After the divination, Apicius was agitated. There was no more friendly discussion on the way back to his domus, which was a short walk outside of town. I was glad for the silence. It gave me time to think about the whirring of birds still spiraling in my mind. The last time I&#x2019;d seen birds fly in such a manner was the morning my previous master, Maximus, had fallen dead as his slaves were helping him don his toga. If birds foretold death to Maximus, what did the flock of pigeons mean for Apicius? Did they mean anything for me? Terror held court in the circle of my heart.<br> <br>This terror took new form when I saw the vastness of the estate where I was to work. Apicius lived in a grand domus that rested on a high ridge with sweeping views of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It was larger and more elaborate than any I had seen, despite the fact that I&#x2019;d been owned by three different patricians, each among the very rich. I was not prepared for the opulence of the house that lay before me. Apicius led us through a labyrinth of painted corridors that sometimes opened toward the ocean and the beach below. We passed through the peristylium, and I almost gasped aloud. The courtyard was immense, and laden with fountains and small running streams. Flowers bloomed everywhere and the rich smell of thyme permeated the air as we crushed the growing herbs against the stones beneath our feet. In an unusual design for a domus, one side of the peristylium was open toward the sea, and specially rigged gates could be closed to create a wall against the elements if the need arose. The size of the house was massive. I tried to imagine how many slaves worked for Apicius. There must have been hundreds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sotas, take the boy to the kitchen and start him working,&#x201d; Apicius ordered.<br> <br>A sour taste rose in my mouth. &#x201c;But, Dominus, I need more time to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as the words escaped my mouth I knew that I should not have said them.<br> <br>Apicius whirled around. &#x201c;Do not question me. Sotas will take you to the kitchen, where you will cook me the cena meal you described, with two exceptions. I don&#x2019;t want Parthian chicken. Instead, you will cook me your &#x2018;specialty&#x2019; ham in pastry and there will be lobster instead of mussels.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then his tone changed. &#x201c;Eat no food tonight you did not prepare by your...</p><h2>Willie Was Different (Dragonfly Books)</h2><p>Beloved American artist Norman Rockwell wrote and illustrated just one children's book, and now it's on the <i>Dragonfly</i> list!

A neuroanatomist by profession, she observed her own mind completely deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life, all within the space of four brief hours. As the damaged left side of her brain--the rational, grounded, detail- and time-oriented side--swung in and out of function, Taylor alternated between two distinct and opposite realties: the euphoric nirvana of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace; and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized Jill was having a stroke, and enabled her to seek help before she was lost completely.<br><br> In <i>My Stroke of Insight</i>, Taylor shares her unique perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery, and the sense of omniscient understanding she gained from this unusual and inspiring voyage out of the abyss of a wounded brain. It would take eight years for Taylor to heal completely. Because of her knowledge of how the brain works, her respect for the cells composing her human form, and most of all an amazing mother, Taylor completely repaired her mind and recalibrated her understanding of the world according to the insights gained from her right brain that morning of December 10th. <br><br> Today Taylor is convinced that the stroke was the best thing that could have happened to her. It has taught her that the feeling of nirvana is never more than a mere thought away. By <i>stepping to the right of our left brains</i>, we can all uncover the feelings of well-being and peace that are so often sidelined by our own brain chatter. A fascinating journey into the mechanics of the human mind, <i>My Stroke of Insight</i> is both a valuable recovery guide for anyone touched by a brain injury, and an emotionally stirring testimony that deep internal peace truly is accessible to anyone, at any time. <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for Jill Bolte Taylor</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your first reaction when you realized what was happening to your body was one you would expect: "Oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke!" Your second, though, was a little more surprising: "Wow, this is so cool!" What could be cool about a stroke? </p><p> <strong>Taylor:</strong> I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who is only 18 months older than I am. He was very different in the way he perceived experiences and then chose to behave. As a result, I became fascinated with the human brain and how it creates our perception of reality. He was eventually diagnosed with the brain disorder schizophrenia, and I dedicated my career to the postmortem investigation of the human brain in an attempt to understand, at a biological level, what are the differences between my brain and my brother&#x2019;s brain. On the morning of the stroke, I realized that my brain was no longer functioning like a "normal" brain and this insight into my brother's reality excited me. I was fascinated to intimately understand what it might be like on the inside for someone who would not be diagnosed as normal. Through the eyes of a curious scientist, this was an absolutely rare and fascinating experience for me to witness the breakdown of my own mind. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What did you learn about the brain from your stroke and your recovery that your scientific training hadn't prepared you for? </p><p> <strong>Taylor:</strong> My scientific training did not teach me anything about the human spirit and the value of compassion. I had been trained as a scientist, not as a clinician. I can only hope that we are teaching our future physicians about compassion in medicine, and I know that some medical schools, including the Indiana University School of Medicine, have created a curriculum with this intention. </p><p> My training as a scientist, however, did provide me with a roadmap to how the body and brain work. And although I lost my left cognitive mind that thinks in language, I retained my right hemisphere that thinks in pictures. As a result, although I could not communicate with the external world, I had an intuitive understanding about what I needed to do in order to create an environment in which the cells in my brain could be happy and healthy enough that they could regain their function. In addition, because of my training, I had an innate trust in the ability of my brain to be able to recover itself and my mother and I respected the organ by listening to it. For example, when I was tired, I allowed my brain to sleep, and when I was fresh and capable of focusing my attention, we gave me age-appropriate toys and tools with which to work. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your stroke affected functions in your left brain, leaving you to what you call the "la-la land" of your right hemisphere. What was it like to live in your right brain, and then to rebuild your left? </p><p><strong>Taylor:</strong> When the cells in my left brain became nonfunctional because they were swimming in a pool of blood, they lost their ability to inhibit the cells in my right hemisphere. In my right brain, I shifted into the consciousness of the present moment. I was in the right here, right now awareness, with no memories of my past and no perception of the future. The beauty of La-la land (my right hemisphere experience of the present moment) was that everything was an explosion of magnificent stimulation and I dwelled in a space of euphoria. This is great way to exist if you don't have to communicate with the external world or care whether or not you have the capacity to learn. I found that in order for me to be able to learn anything, however, I had to take information from the last moment and apply it to the present moment. When my left hemisphere was completely nonfunctional early on, it was impossible for me to learn, which was okay with me, but I am sure it was frustrating for those around me. A simple example of this was trying to put on my shoes and socks. I eventually became physically capable of putting my shoes and socks on, but I had no ability to understand why I would have to put my socks on before my shoes. To me they were simply independent actions that were not related and I did not have the cognitive ability to figure out the appropriate sequencing of the events. Over time, I regained the ability to weave moments back together to create an expanse of time, and with this ability came the ability to learn methodically again. Life in La-la land will always be just a thought away, but I am truly grateful for the ability to think with linearity once again. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What can we learn about our brains and ourselves from your experience, even if we haven't lived through the kind of brain trauma you have? </p><p> <strong>Taylor:</strong> I learned that I have much more say about what goes on between my ears than I was ever taught and I believe that this is true for all of us. I used to understand that I had the ability to stop thinking about one thing by consciously choosing to preoccupy my mind with thinking about something else. But I had no idea that it only took 90 seconds for me to have an emotional circuit triggered, flush a physiological response through my body and then flush completely out of me. We can all learn that we can take full responsibility for what thoughts we are thinking and what emotional circuitry we are feeling. Knowing this and acting on this can lead us into feeling a wonderful sense of well-being and peacefulness. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You are the "Singin' Scientist" for Harvard's Brain Bank (just as you were before your stroke). Could you tell us about the Brain Bank (in song or not)? </p><p> <strong>Taylor:</strong> There is a long-term shortage of brain tissue donated for research into the severe mental illnesses. Most people don&#x2019;t realize that when you sign the back of your license as an organ donor, the brain is not included. If you would like to donate your brain for research, you must contact a brain bank directly. There is also a shortage of "normal control" tissue for research. The bottom line reality is that if there were more tissue available for research, then more scientists would be dedicating their careers to the study of the severe mental illnesses and we would have more answers about what is going on with these disorders. The numbers of mentally ill individuals in our society are staggering. The most serious and disabling conditions affect about 6 percent--or one in 17--adults and 9-13 percent of children in the United States. Half of all lifetime conditions of mental illness start by age 14 years, and three-fourths by age 24 years.</p><p> For more information about brain donation to the Harvard brain bank, please call 1-800-BRAINBANK or visit them at: www.brainbank.mclean.org</p><p> If you would like to hear me sing the brain bank jingle, please visit www.drjilltaylor.com! </p>Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist who teaches at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Bloomington, Indiana.

An introduction relates the history of the piano and traces the history of the Steinway itself. The story then follows step by step the creation of the concert grand piano from 12,000 individual parts. The exquisitely detailed and beautifully-rendered drawings set the tone for the dignity and care with which the ultimate grand piano - the only one in the world still made by hand - is crafted. Hardcover.</p><p>The piano may well be the world's most versatile instrument, and the Steinway is the United States's most celebrated manufacturer. This handsome volume takes you inside the process of building a Steinway, from the selection of the woods (yellow birch, sugar maple, sugar pine, yellow poplar, Sitka spruce, and, for the exteriors, various hardwoods) through the construction of the soundboard and keyboard, from the manufacture of the piano's rim and case through the building of the metal harp that holds the strings, and to the final assembly and finishing. Along the way are sections on history and physics (good tone doesn't just happen) and a useful glossary. <i>88 Keys</i> is a fascinating and eminently readable book for anyone with an interest in the art of the piano.Miles Chaplin is a successful freelance journalist and screenwriter, and a fifth-generation descendant of Steinway&#39;s founder, Henry Engelhard Steinway.

Knowledge of the premortal existence becomes crucial in our search. In the most positive sense, The Life Before is a journey backward. At the foundation of his exploration, author and teacher Brent L. Top explains why various cultures and religions believe in a life before this one. He cites biblical evidence of our premortal existence and points to revelations given to Joseph Smith and other latter-day prophets. Together, these resources build upon each other and work to take our understanding beyond the veil and into &#39;timelessness.&#39; The Life Before first delves into such fascinating topics as our spiritual origins and capacities, premortal organization and harmony, agency, opposition, foreordination, the eternal nature of the priesthood, and the war in heaven--all elements that are &#39;timeless.&#39; The author&#39;s focus then shifts to a discussion of &#39;time&#39;--our earthly existence--and the reader learns what the &#39;here and now&#39; has to do with everything that happened &#39;then.&#39; This well-researched, well-written book--possibly the most thorough treatment of this subject--presents a rich array of scriptures and other inspired words (more than most of us know about) plus a solid interpretive commentary that resists speculation while still illuminating the thrilling aspects of this fascinating topic. These exciting insights into our first estate will buoy you up spiritually, increase your knowledge and understanding of the life before, and motivate you to live worthy to return to the presence of our Eternal Father.</p><p></p><h2>When the World Stopped to Listen: Van Cliburn&#39;s Cold War Triumph, and Its Aftermath</h2><p><b>From the acclaimed author of <i>A Natural History of the Piano, </i>the captivating story of the 1958 international piano competition in Moscow, where, at the height of Cold War tensions, an American musician showed the potential of art to change the world.</b> <br><br>April of 1958--the Iron Curtain was at its heaviest, and the outcome of the Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition seemed preordained. Nonetheless, as star musicians from across the globe descended on Moscow, an unlikely favorite emerged: Van Cliburn, a polite, lanky Texan whose passionate virtuosity captured the Russian spirit. <br><br>This is the story of what unfolded that spring--for Cliburn and the other competitors, jurors, party officials, and citizens of the world who were touched by the outcome. It is a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most remarkable events in musical history, filled with political intrigue and personal struggle as artists strove for self-expression and governments jockeyed for prestige. And, at the core of it all: the value of artistic achievement, the supremacy of the heart, and the transcendent freedom that can be found, through music, even in the darkest moments of human history.</p><p><b>STUART ISACOFF</b> is a pianist, writer, and the founder of <i>Piano Today</i> magazine, which he edited for nearly three decades. A winner of the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for excellence in writing about music, he is a regular contributor to <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>and many other publications. He is also the author of <i>The Natural History of the Piano</i> and <i>Temperament: How Music Became a Battleground for the Great Minds of Western Civilization.</i> He lives in Closter, New Jersey.<i>The Land of Snow and Spies<br></i><br>OPENED&nbsp; IN&nbsp; 1956&nbsp; as a symbol of friendship between the Soviet Union and China, the Pekin Hotel&#x2014;&#x201c;heavily ocher in color, both the stone outside and the pillared lobby, and used to house privileged, usually Communist visitors,&#x201d; remembered <i>New York Times</i> correspondent Max Frankel&#x2014;featured high ceilings and spacious rooms, stucco moldings, and wood-and-marble interiors (but surprisingly tiny, cramped elevators). The Pekin quickly became one of the city&#x2019;s most elite locations. It also garnered a reputation as &#x201c;the KGB hotel,&#x201d; a tag borne out by the hall monitors who took notes on everyone&#x2019;s comings and goings, along with the listening devices people were forever uncovering in their quarters.<br><br> Pianist Evelyne Crochet stumbled across one while trying to use a hair dryer. &#x201c;I had trouble plugging it into the wall,&#x201d; she explained, &#x201c;so I opened the electrical panel and found a microphone hidden there. I started saying really silly things, bad words, like &#x2018;shit&#x2019; in Russian. And I announced loudly, &#x2018;Look at this . . . a microphone!&#x2019; My roommate, another French girl, was laughing uncontrollably.&#x201d; She was not alone. At the Hotel Metropol, which housed the jurors, the French judge, Armand de Gontaut-Biron, stood on a chair nightly and cursed at the chandelier after recognizing a microphone hidden among the glistening crystals. How well the Russian eavesdroppers understood his colloquial French is another question.<br><br>Some Westerners took the intense scrutiny of their Soviet hosts as a call to action. &#x201c;As a young girl, I was very playful and made a game of losing my minders,&#x201d; says Crochet. As she walked&nbsp;from the hotel to the conservatory to practice, she noticed several little alleys along the way. One day she ducked into one, entered a bicycle store, and left through a different exit, losing the man who was following her. When she arrived back at the hotel that night, an official contingent was waiting.<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;You cannot do that,&#x2019; I was told. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x2019; I countered with, &#x2018;Is it dangerous to live in Russia? What&#x2019;s so dangerous about it?&#x2019; &#x201d; Nothing much happened as a result, she says. But there was a feeling of secrecy everywhere, &#x201c;and a lot of suspicion<br> between people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Participants from free societies found themselves herded, scru-tinized, and sometimes tricked by a shadow force, like ancient Athenians in the grip of their invisible gods. If the inhabitants of that long-ago empire felt bludgeoned by mighty Poseidon or roiled by mischievous Erinyes, here the ever-present agents of influence resided not on Mount Olympus but in the Kremlin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crochet received special attention. &#x201c;We all had an assigned &#x2018;translator,&#x2019; &#x201d; she recalls. &#x201c;I knew a little Russian, so they were suspicious of me immediately. They thought it was strange that I had a good accent, so I was always followed.&#x201d; For the Soviet&nbsp;authorities, not a thing went unnoticed. At a Kremlin reception, Khrushchev stopped in front of her and asked why she spoke Russian. She was flabbergasted that he knew. &#x201c;Then he asked me for the name of the French woman who had a friendship with Lazar Berman&#x2014;the one he would later marry.&#x201d; Khrushchev often overstepped personal boundaries in a way that verged on rudeness, even with people he liked. The rotund Soviet leader grilled jury member Sequeira Costa about his slight build&#x2014;&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; he demanded, &#x201c;do you suffer from hunger in Portugal?&#x201d;&#x2014; just as he would later grill Van about his height.<br><br>Annie Marchand had an even more troubling experience. She met and became friends with a violist in Moscow who spoke French. They went out a lot. He took her to the Bolshoi The-ater and they visited his friends. The Soviets reached out to the French government and asked them to put an end to the rela-tionship. Soon she got a phone call from the secretary of the French ambassador asking about her intentions. Her friend was from a very prominent Communist family, she was told, and the Soviets would be very upset if they chose to marry.<br><br> Journalists, keenly aware of being followed, sometimes engaged in games like Crochet&#x2019;s hide-and-seek. From the files of the American embassy a report from August 1958 tells of a cor-respondent with a reputation as a man-about-town who often managed to shake the surveillance team that followed him on his social escapades. &#x201c;On one occasion he returned to his car with his date to find the tires riddled with nails,&#x201d; it said. The man hailed a taxi and offered the driver one hundred rubles to elude the car that was following them, which, he claimed, was being driven by the lady&#x2019;s husband. After the driver had successfully lost the tail, the newsman paid him and offered thanks for sparing them the husband&#x2019;s wrath. &#x201c;The driver retorted with a smile, &#x2018;You mean all three of them.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>As the pianists settled in to their hotels, frustration mounted. &#x201c;People were nice, but the service was lousy,&#x201d; said Costa of the Metropol&#x2019;s restaurant. He sat at a table in the dining room for no less than forty minutes, waiting for a waiter to show up. He knew a little Russian at the time, and asked what was going on. &#x201c;Oh, this table doesn&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; was the reply. He later learned there was a special dining room for the jury&#x2014;huge and noisy, with a band playing fox-trots and tangos, where &#x201c;everyone was smoking terrible cigarettes. And it took more than two hours for the food to arrive.&#x201d;<br><br> Truman Capote had a similar experience in a Leningrad hotel three years earlier, when he was traveling with the American company of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. The service was minimal, he found,<br><br> and the ambience strange: on the dance floor were couples who seemed gripped by fantasies of a forbidden world brought on by the strains of the American jazz being played. &#x201c;Madame Ner-vitsky danced well,&#x201d; Capote wrote of one patron, &#x201c;but her body was tense, her hands icy. &#x2018;<i>J&#x2019;adore la musique des N�gres</i>. It&#x2019;s so<br> wicked. So vile.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Pekin&#x2019;s attractiveness rested partly on the professed avail-ability of the traditional flavors of China in its dining room<br><br> (a later incarnation of the place announced such delicacies as &#x201c;jugged hare,&#x201d; and &#x201c;braised pig&#x2019;s trotters in pimiento sauce&#x201d;), but<br><br> none of the Tchaikovsky pianists ever got a whiff of such culinary exotica. &#x201c;The food was mediocre,&#x201d; noted Marchand, &#x201c;and there was little to be had, except for plenty of caviar and black bread.&#x201d; She would often sit for twenty minutes before a waiter peeled himself away from the wall and started ladling some kind of cab-bage soup. Even the seemingly endless mounds of caviar were not to everyone&#x2019;s liking. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t care for it,&#x201d; recalls Dodi Ashkenazy, the Icelandic competitor who later married Vladimir. &#x201c;So I gave all of my caviar to Van.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, Western visitors found the hotels seriously wanting. When first opened in 1907, the luxurious Metropol was the only lodging in Moscow to offer hot water, refrigerators, and elevators. It served for a while as an official residence of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee after the Revolution of 1917. By the 1930s, it was again attracting sophisticated guests, including such luminaries as George Bernard Shaw and Bertolt Brecht. But by 1958, things had deteriorated dramatically&#x2014;even the plumb-ing had become a serious issue.<br> &nbsp;<br> Costa&#x2019;s wife was shocked by the condition of things. The tub in the bathroom was almost black, so she filled it with alcohol as a disinfectant, and then lit it all on fire. &#x201c;The people from the floor&#x2014;on each floor they had special KGB people taking care of things&#x2014;came running,&#x201d; says Costa. &#x201c;The Russians weren&#x2019;t crazy about this, and not just because of the danger of fire. There was a lot of cueing up for goods, with long lines everywhere. They were upset that we lit the alcohol on fire instead of drinking it. In their view, my wife was wasting a valuable asset.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Some pianists began to make close observations on their own of the dynamics of everyday life in Moscow. Crochet was shocked to see, on the streets, that most of the heavy work&#x2014; fixing the pavement, driving trucks&#x2014;was done by women. &#x201c;Where else did that happen?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;It was a sight to see.&#x201d; In that respect at least, the culture seemed more advanced than that in the West. But they were way behind in so many other ways, she noted. Soviet architecture was ugly, &#x201c;as if deliberately meant to depress people, though the monuments&#x2014;and historic places like Lenin&#x2019;s Tomb, and Red Square&#x2014;were beautiful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She found that people hungered for something better. &#x201c;Some-one approached me and asked, &#x2018;Will you sell me your coat?&#x2019; But&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t have a fancy coat&#x2014;my sister had lent it to me for the trip. It was very light, and the climate was so cold&#x2014;when I went out-side, ice formed in my nose.&#x201d; Roger Boutry also attracted atten-tion with his garment. &#x201c;Nearly everyone wore a black overcoat,&#x201d; he remembers, &#x201c;and I had one of camel hair. People thought it was quite special, and they wanted to touch it.&#x201d;<br><br>The interest in Western clothing was telling. Marchand recalled going to Moscow&#x2019;s biggest department store, GUM, in search of a souvenir, and finding nothing there except shoes made in Bulgaria that seemed to be constructed of cardboard. Yet in the special section reserved for important Party members, the shelves were full. &#x201c;The people at the top had absolutely every-thing they wanted,&#x201d; she noted.<br> Officials hewed to the Party line, consistently asserting Soviet superiority. Crochet was taken out to a Georgian restaurant and presented with a glass of champagne&#x2014;as if she&#x2019;d never heard of the refreshment before. She pointed out that it came from France. &#x201c;They had no idea, and thought it was a Russian term.&#x201d; That was a logical assumption when the official position was that all good things had to have come from the homeland.<br><br> However, the warmth and the yearning of the Russians were palpable, remembered Crochet. &#x201c;They were easily moved, and cried a lot [at musical performances]. You had to take that with a grain of salt&#x2014;it was their character. I came from France, where we analyze our thoughts.&#x201d; For Paris-raised Crochet, life was a rational argument. In Russia, where strong emotions were the coin of the realm, life was a broken heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, laughter could bubble up from beneath the sur-face. A standing joke in Odessa involved a barber who was asked why he always talked politics. &#x201c;Because,&#x201d; came the answer, &#x201c;it is easier to cut your hair when it&#x2019;s standing on end.&#x201d;<br><br> American pianist Misha Dichter, who nearly won the Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in 1966, was at a party with his pia-nist wife, Cipa, at Lev Vlassenko&#x2019;s Moscow apartment in 1969 or 1970. On the piano was a special commemorative edition of Beethoven&#x2019;s &#x201c;Appassionata&#x201d; Sonata, which was known to be Lenin&#x2019;s favorite piece. &#x201c;I looked at the music and saw that the fingerings&#x201d;&#x2014;editorial markings indicating which finger to use on particular notes&#x2014;&#x201c;were so perverse that a pianist would have to play the music by positioning himself upside down,&#x201d; remem-bers Dichter. &#x201c; &#x2018;Maybe they were Lenin&#x2019;s fingerings,&#x2019; Cipa com-mented, in full hearing of the crowd. Some muffled laughter erupted at the remark, but the partygoers all held themselves in check,&#x201d; recalls Dichter. &#x201c;Afterward, though, people would come up to us on the street, giggling and saying, &#x2018;We heard about Cipa&#x2019;s comment on Lenin&#x2019;s fingering!&#x2019; Then they would burst into laughter. It went on for days.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Fire in the Sun</h2><p>Relates the story of Marid Audran, who rises from street punk to the right-hand-man of the boss of twenty-first-century Algiers, a position filled with danger</p><p><p>A winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, GEORGE ALEC EFFINGER was the author of <i>What Entropy Means to Me</i>, <i>Schrodinger's Kitten</i>, and the "Marid Audrian" sequence that begins with <i>When Gravity Fails</i>.

Although written before the events of September 11, the essence of Maalouf's rumination couldn't be more relevant.</p></p><p><i>In the Name of Identity</i> is as close to summer reading as philosophy gets. It is a personal, sometimes even intimate, account of identity-in-the-world, not a treatise on the thorny metaphysics of identity. A novelist by trade, Amin Maalouf is a fluid writer, and he is aided by Barbara Bray's award-winning translation. His aim is to illuminate the roots of violence and hatred, which he sees in tribalistic forms of identity. He argues that our convictions and notions of identity--whether cultural, religious, national, or ethnic--are socially habituated and frequently dangerous. We'd give them up, he argues, if we thought more closely about them.<p> Though the book has been heralded as radical and surprising, Maalouf essentially espouses an Enlightenment sensibility, a faith in the brotherhood of man. He is a believer in progress, arguing that "the wind of globalisation, while it could lead us to disaster, could also lead us to success." In fact, he envisions a globalized world in which our local identities are subordinated to a broader "allegiance to the human community itself." Maalouf wants us to retain our distinctiveness, but he wants it subsumed under the nave of common understanding. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><p>Amin Maalouf is an eminent novelist, whose books include <b>The Rock of Tanios</b>, which won the 1993 Goncourt Prize, France's most prestigious literary award.

Flash forward to the present, when the reader is introduced to wealthy Alexander Mendeneres, whose scheming and vindictive wife, Valerie, has stolen the scrolls, bringing them from Argentina to Manhattan hoping to sell them for profit. Alex finds himself forced to use his precocious 10-year-old daughter, Maria, as a pawn in the battle with Valerie, but Maria takes matters into her own hands when she finds herself alone in New York, teaming up with lonely 20-something editor Dani Arnold. Kidnappings, danger and romance ensue. Despite the contemporary setting, the characters all seem to have walked out of early Hollywood films. The bad guys could be Cagney co-stars; Maria is a modern-day Shirley Temple, dispensing advice on politics, smoking and love; and Alex is melodramatic in a Fernando Lamas sort of way. As for Dani, she's the kind of bravely foolish heroine of yesteryear who insists on going off half-cocked and alone, yet she stops for a cigarette when she stumbles over a corpse in the enemy's lair. Everything about the novel, including the paint-by-numbers cover, is so anachronistically clich&#x201a;d, it's practically high camp. But Michaels's many fans and other readers who prefer their chaste romance to be sealed only with kisses may not mind. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Across the Sea of Suns</h2><p>Lancer, a spaceship built to specifications found in the computers of an alien derelict, journeys to the star, Ra, from which the Earth has received mysterious radio transmissions in English</p><p>Gregory Benford is a professor of physics at the University of California at Irvine as well as a critically acclaimed author of science fiction.

Initially unable to communicate, Avery is given plastic surgery that makes her "good as new." Stripped of her identity and completely vulnerable, she learns of an insider's plot to assassinate her "husband"--and she's supposedly in on it. Reporter's instincts may be the initial reason for keeping up the charade, but soon other instincts kick in and Avery finds herself trapped in a world of power, politics, lies, and lust. <i>Mirror Image</i> is full-speed from the start, and doesn't ease up until the final, dramatic showdown.</p><p> "Before I'm finished, I'm going to know which one of you killed my mother," proclaims Alexandra Gaither, a striking young attorney out for revenge.

Told with lust and affection, karate and tenderness, slapstickery, ferocity, and heart, <i>Hot Pink</i> is the work of a major talent in his sharpest form.<br><br>*<i>Hot Pink</i> comes in three resplendent colors (pink, gray and blue).</p><p>Adam Levin is the author of <i>The Instructions</i>, the winner of the New York Public Library's Young Lions Award. His stories have appeared in <i>Tin House</i>, <i>McSweeney's</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>. Winner of the 2003 Summer Literary Seminars Fiction Contest and the 2004 Joyce Carol Oates Fiction Prize, he lives in Chicago, where he teaches Creative Writing at the School of the Art Institute.<br><b><i>The Millions</i>' and <i>Flavorwire</i>'s most anticipated books of 2012.</b><br><br> Adam Levin&#x2019;s new story collection, 'Hot Pink,' is about how love family love, romantic love, love between friends turns us into people we never thought we&#x2019;d become. Today you&#x2019;re one person, tomorrow enter love, and all bets are off. You could turn out to be anybody... Levin is especially adept at capturing the way we sometimes change against our will... In addition to love and lust, there&#x2019;s plenty of havoc in these stories... there&#x2019;s an exuberance here that is absent from safer and too often soulless collections... Life in 'Hot Pink' is raw, messy, yet replete with moments of awkward grace.&#x201d;<br> <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Readers put off by the enormity of Levin's debut novel, <i>The Instructions</i> (which clocks in at over 1,000 pages), can rest easy this hilarious, tenderly wrought story collection dazzles without the commitment. In the hands of a lesser writer, Levin's vaudevillian cast of characters--like the legless lesbian prodigy of "Considering the Bittersweet End of Susan Falls" or the titular young woman of 'Jane Tell' who enjoys being punched by strangers--may have come across as pat and sensationalistic. But Levin is interested in how language shapes and limits reality, and he deftly uses his ear for voice to elaborate on these ideas. He also possesses a logician's dexterity when it comes to plotting, nimbly anchoring his linguistic concerns to surprising story arcs. In 'Scientific American,' a financial trader grows increasingly obsessed with determining the reason behind his bedroom wall oozing gel, and in the title story, a self-described Ukrainian "meathead" sees subtext in everything, but laments his inability to gauge words correctly when it matters: 'Like hot pink? For years I thought it was regular pink that looked sexy on whoever was wearing it.' Despite the encumbering instruction-manual frame of 'How to Play The Guy,' Levin's newest cements his position as a writer with the daring and talent to push the boundaries of short fiction."<br> <i>Publisher's Weekly</i><br><br>"<i>Hot Pink</i> leaves readers wondering what might be lurking nearby, on the verge of uprooting their own lives."<br> <i>Chicago Magazine</i><br><br>"Each story in this anticipated follow-up to Levin's megalithic debut <i>The Instructions</i>, has its own cracks-fissures in otherwise recognizable realities that expose the hidden aspects of everyday experience."<br> <i>Nylon</i><br><br>"From walls that ooze unnameable, unidentifiable gel, through makers of children's dolls designed to mimic the stages of digestive health, to old widowers in retirement looking back over their marriages, Levin manages to find the pathos and humor in living an 'ordinary' existence.

It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and&nbsp;went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child&#x2019;s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying.<br><br>Two years after its publication, <em>The Exorcist</em> was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel&#x2019;s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS&#x2019;s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. <em>The Exorcist</em> was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark.<br><br>Purposefully raw and profane, <em>The Exorcist</em> still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is &#x201c; just a story.&#x201d; Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>When originally published in 1971, <i>The Exorcist</i> became not only a bestselling literary phenomenon, but one of the most frightening and controversial novels ever written. (When the author adapted his book to the screen two years later, it then became one of the most terrifying movies ever made.) The deceptively simple story focuses on Regan, the 11-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C.; the child apparently is possessed by an ancient demon. It's up to a small group of overwhelmed yet determined humans to somehow rescue Regan from this unspeakable fate. Purposefully raw and profane, this novel still has the extraordinary ability to literally shock us into forgetting that it is "just a story." <i>The Exorcist</i> remains a truly unforgettable reading experience.

Readers experience the year 1895 along with Rose as she picks apples at the neighbors' farm and helps to prepare sorghum molasses. They feel her jealousy as the hired hand, Abe, goes courting, and join in her dilemma when she is unsure whether she is poor or rich. When Rose's father makes her a sled for Christmas, she is overjoyed. Then she discovers that Abe's little brother has received nothing as both his parents are dead. Can she sacrifice her joy for Swiney? The characters are finely drawn; the era and the setting are alive as well. The simple charcoal drawings are compatible with the slow, quiet thread of the narrative. This book is a must for anyone who enjoys Laura Ingalls Wilder's "Little House" series (HarperCollins) and wishes to follow up with this contemporary installment, but it also stands on its own quite well.<br><i>Katrina Yurenka, Jaffrey Public Library, NH</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Snitte: The Danish Art of Whittling: Make beautiful wooden birds</h2><p><b>Create simple but stunning bird sculptures with snitte, the Danish art of wood whittling&#x2014;even if you're a beginner! </b><br> Master the art and craftsmanship of snitte, Denmark&#x2019;s traditional whittling technique.

Arax became a journalist in order to acquire the skills he needed, and then 20 years later returned to Fresno to ferret out the truth about his father's murder. His book is a detailed and absorbing account of multiple generations of his Armenian family and of his quest to come to terms not only with his father's death and life, but also with his own obsession with the case. As the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writes, "Almost every American town harbors some brutal secret, but few produce writers like Mark Arax with both the courage and artistic talent needed to coax the story out and shape it into fine literature. Of course, Arax had an extra incentive: the footsteps he followed ran straight through his own family, straight through his own heart."In 1972, Arax's father, Ara, was killed by two shooters at his Fresno nightclub, when Mark was 15; the murder was never solved. But the bond between father and son was especially strong, and Mark, who went on to become a journalist with the Los Angeles Times, struggled for years with his compulsion to solve it. Eventually, he moved back to his hometown for that purpose. This unusual, introspective memoir is the result. It reveals that the large Armenian American community in Fresno was made up of survivors of the 1915 Turkish massacre and their descendants, who fought against constant discrimination. Mark's father and his uncle built a chain of five groceries, which failed, and Ara then bought the nightclub, where drugs became an increasing problem. The idealistic and stubborn Ara came to know who the big drug dealers were. Determined to blow the whistle on them, he revealed his plans to some of the very policemen who were protecting them. The murder came soon after. Mark developed a clear idea of who the architects of the slaying were as well as insights into his father, other family members, the "fetid town" and, most important, himself. Although overlong, his book makes for absorbing reading. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Continuing Silence of a Poet: The Collected Stories of A.B.

Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. &#34;Last Exit to Brooklyn&#34; was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers including Anthony Burgess.</p><p>The first novel to articulate the rage and pain of life in "the other America," Last Exit to Brooklyn is a classic of postwar American writing. Selby's searing portrait of the powerless, the homeless, the dispossessed, is as fiercely and frighteningly apposite today as it was when it was first published more than thirty-five years ago. <p>"An extraordinary achievement,...a vision of hell so stern it cannot be chuckled or raged aside."--The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"As dramatic and immediate as the click of a switchblade knife."--Los Angeles Times </p><p>"The raw strength and concentrated power of Last Exit to Brooklyn make it one of the really great works of fiction about the underground labyrinth of our cities."--Harry T. Moore </p><p>"Last Exit to Brooklyn should explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America and still be eagerly read in a hundred years."--Allen Ginsberg </p><p>"Drops like a sledgehammer. Emotionally beaten, one leaves it a different person-slightly changed, educated by pain, as Goethe said."--The Nation </p><p>"Selby has an unerring instinct for honing our collapse into novels as glittering and as cutting as pure, black, jagged glass."--Saturday Review </p><p>"Scorching, unrelenting, pulsing."--Newsweek </p><p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928. Last Exit to Brooklyn, his first novel, was originally published in 1964. He has since written five other novels, The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, and The Willow Tree, and a collection of short stories, Song of the Silent Snow. Mr. Selby lives in Los Angeles.</p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: &#39;I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.&#39; In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, Song of the Silent Snow, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream starred Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn and was directed by Darren Aronofsky. Hubert Selby Jr died in Highland Park, Los Angeles, California in April 2004.</p><h2>American Folk Magick</h2><p>The author of &#34;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&#34; and &#34;Angels&#34; discusses the charms, spells, and herbs of the Pennsylvania Dutch region with its influences from native Pow Wow magick.</p><p><p><strong>Silver RavenWolf </strong>(Pennsylvania) is a nationally recognized leader and elder of Wicca, and her writing has been instrumental in guiding the future of one of the fastest-growing faiths in America today.

Each score is written in prose and may be read by musicians as instructions for performance or by general readers as descriptions of imaginary musical activities. In response to Simon's searching questions, Lucier expands on each composition, not only explaining its genesis and development but also revealing its importance to the vigorously experimental American tradition to which Alvin Lucier belongs.<br><br>Many of his compositions jolt conventional notions of the role of composer, performer, and listener, and the spaces in which they play and listen. His works are scored for an astonishing range of instruments: seashells, subway stations, toy crickets, sonar guns, violins, synthesizers, bird calls, and Bunsen burners. All are unique explorations of acoustic phenomena - echoes, brain waves, room resonances - and radically transform the idea of music as metaphor into that of music as physical fact. <br></p><p>ALVIN LUCIER was born in Nashua, NH, and attended the Portsmouth Abbey School, Yale, and Brandeis. He lived in Rome for two years on a Fulbright Scholarship. He has performed extensively in the United States and Europe in solo concerts and with the Sonic Arts Union, which he co-founded with composers Robert Ashley, David Behrman, and Gordon Mumma, and with the Viola Farber Dance Company. He has taught and lectured at Harvard, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Center for Music Experiment at the University of California at San Diego, and from 1962 to 1969 was on the faculty of Brandeis University. He is currently professor of music and chairperson of the music department at Wesleyan University.<br><br>Lucier has pioneered in many areas of music composition and performance, including the notation of performers' physical gestures, the use of brain waves in live musical performance, the generation of visual imagery by sound in vibrating media, and the evocation of room acoustics for musical purposes. In collaboration with electronic designer John Fullemann, he recently created a completely solar-powered sound piece in the foyer of the City Savings Bank in Middletown, Conn.<br><br>He has also made music for the theatre, including the Broadway production of John Roc's Fire! and the American Shakespeare Festival production of Henry V. Several of his works can be heard on CBS Odyssey, Mainstream, Source, Cramps (Italy), and Lovely Music records.<br><br>DOUGLAS SIMON earned both a B.A. and an M.A. in music at Wesleyan University. He has composed music and sound for summer and off-Broadway theater productions. He owns and operates Studio Consultants, Inc., a New York City firm engaged in the acoustic and electronic design of recording studios. He conducted these interviews with Lucier during the period (1968-78) in which most of the scores included in Chambers were composed. <br>&#x201c;Alvin Lucier&#x2019;s work in live and taped electronic music has produced beautiful and influential results. I particularly admire I am Sitting in a Room as a moving, personal taped speech piece, and Music for Solo Performer as the first work with brain wave generated sounds. Reading Alvin Lucier&#x2019;s reflections on these and many other works gives one a clear insight into both the actual making of these pieces and the lucid and original mind that produced them.&#x201d; (Steve Reich)<br><br>&#x201c;Lucier and I met for the first time in Cleveland, where we were giving a concert together with David Tudor. Lucier was performing his Music for Solo Performer. The atmosphere was charged as the electrodes were applied to his scalp in order to detect the brain waves. I kept thinking that he looked like Edison discovering the light bulb...In my mind, Lucier is the poet of electronic music.&#x201d; (Pauline Oliveros)<br><br>&#x201c;Pythagoras would be very jealous of Alvin Lucier. Whereas Prof. Pythagoras could only speculate about the resonance of sound and the cosmos, Prof. Lucier has managed to penetrate into these resonances cosmologiques through his deep insight into sonic biology, medical electronics, and the most advanced post-modern aesthetics. As a composer he has mastered the subtlety of a sushi cook in orchestrating these heterophonies.&#x201d; (Nam June Paik)</p><h2>Wandering Son, Vol. 3</h2><p><p><strong>A sensitive, sophisticated work of literary manga.</strong></p><p>As shown in the first two volumes of this acclaimed series, Shuichi and his friend Yoshino have a secret: Shuichi is a boy who wants to be a girl, and Yoshino is a girl who wants to be a boy.</p><p>But one day, abruptly, their secret is exposed, and the two find themselves the target of sixth-grade cruelty. Their friendship is strained, as Yoshino makes a half-hearted effort at being a &#x201c;normal girl&#x201d;... and their mentor, Yuki, reveals the harder reality of being transgendered. Meanwhile, Shuichi&#x2019;s sister, Maho, realizes her dream of becoming a model, and drags Shuichi along for the ride. Shuichi meets another boy who wants to be a girl, and finds himself on an arranged date with a boy who doesn't know that the girl he has a crush on was born a boy.</p><p>After an unhurried, almost leisurely buildup that gave us an opportunity to get to know and understand our protagonists, artist Shimura picks up the pace in this latest volume, with tears and laughs aplenty. A sophisticated work translated with rare sophistication by veteran translator and comics scholar Matt Thorn.</p> Black &amp; white throughout</p><p><p><strong>Shimura Takako</strong> lives in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p><strong>Matt Thorn</strong> is from in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. She is a cultural anthropologist, writer, and an associate professor in the manga department at Kyoto Seika University. Her translations include the <em>New York Times</em> Best-Seller <em>Nijigahara Holograph</em> by Inio Asano and Hayao Miyazaki&#x2019;s <em>Nausica� of the Valley of the Wind</em>.</p>&#x201c;Transsexuality is often used in manga for laughs or escapism, but Wandering Son is one of the few manga I&#x2019;ve read that takes its subject matter seriously. Shimura Takako is known for drawing LGBT-friendly manga, and... in Wandering Son she sympathetically and subtly depicts two young people who are transsexuals, or at least have transsexual leanings....It&#x2019;s a tasteful psychological portrait, with a lot of unexpected little meanders and detours... and a pleasant lack of either over the-top tortured drama or polemic speeches about the subject matter. Just wandering along the road of adolescence, watching our heroes discover themselves, is fascinating enough.

It offers nuanced portrayals of these two middle schoolers, their friends, and their families. The tone is sweet, gentle, and hopeful, making it a pleasant reading experience. At the same time, it doesn&#x2019;t turn away from realistic issues like bullying and the pain of experiencing&nbsp;puberty when your body already doesn&#x2019;t match the way you feel inside.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nic Willcox, <em>No Flying No Tights</em></strong></p><h2>Green Wilma, Frog in Space</h2><p>Green Wilma is so determined to catch a tasty fly that she doesn?t notice a family of galactic visitors to her pond.

Poor Wilma, hungry and confused (though also having the ride of her life!). Will the two be able to switch back in time for supper?<p> It?s a warp-speed comedy sure to please the fans of Tedd Arnold?s Geisel Honor?winning <i>Hi! Fly Guy</i>, his beloved Parts books, and especially <i>Green Wilma</i>, which was an IRA-CBC Children?s Choice book and a PBS <i>Storytime</i> featured selection.<br><br></p></p><p>Born in Elmira, New York, Tedd grew up in a family of six with three brothers. His family lived on a farm in Pennsylvania for several years then returned to Elmira until Tedd was ten years old. His father's work then required that they move to Gainesville, Florida. There, Tedd's first art lessons in an abandoned dentist's office over the Happy Hour pool hall eventually led to a fine arts degree from the University of Florida. He and his wife, Carol, started their family in Tallahassee where Tedd worked as a commercial illustrator. Carol, a Kindergarten teacher, drew Tedd's attention to children's books. Their first son, Walter, inspired his breakthrough picture book, <i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i>. His second son, William, now stars in <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i>, a sequel to his first book. He has now published more than 30 books as author and illustrator. When not working on his books, Tedd's interests include tennis, sketching, reading, coin collecting, and the computer.<p>"The inspiration to begin writing and illustrating for children came from my wife, Carol. As a kindergarten teacher, she collected picture books. I was attracted to their colorful pages and the way the words and pictures played with each other, much like the captioned cartoons I had drawn when I was young.</p><p>"Perhaps the biggest surprise of my career as an author is that I'm now going back to elementary school! Visiting young readers in classrooms and libraries is something I love. Kids keep me on my toes and they ask a lot of questions. The number one question seems to be, 'Where do you getyour ideas?' It's also the hardest question to answer because every idea is different. Some ideas seem to pop out of thin air -- while I'm in the shower or walking the dog. Others come from reading or research. But most of my ideas come from my family and the things they do and say.</p><p>"For instance, one time when my first son, Walter, was five years old, I found him lying on the couch, looking pale as a ghost and clutching a Bible to his chest. He was praying! When I asked what was wrong, he wouldn't answer. In fact, he wouldn't even open his mouth. My wife, Carol, finally coaxed a response from him: he pointed inside his mouth. Carol exclaimed, 'You have a loose tooth!' Walter's eyes nearly popped out with fright. We quickly assured him that it was perfectly okay for his tooth to come loose and that a new one would replace it. But Carol and I looked at each other and realized that despite all our efforts to be good parents, we had somehow completely forgotten to warn Walter that teeth fall out! He had thought he was falling apart! I made a little note in my journal; then ten years later, I expanded that memory into my book <i>Parts</i>."</p><p>Tedd Arnold lives in Elmira, New York, with his wife, Carol, two sons, Walter and William, two cats, Cody and Frankie, and one dog, Hershey.</p>The froggy fly chaser introduced in Green Wilma (1993) takes an unexpected ride when she and her buzzing prey are snatched up in error by a pair of similarly pop-eyed alien parents. After a wild interstellar flight,&nbsp;the spacecraft returns to earth, where the relieved purple aliens are reunited with their stranded offspring and Wilma clambers back onto her accustomed log&#x2014;wondering if it was all a dream. The cast members look more like blobby, shell-less M&amp;Ms than frogs in the cartoon illustrations, but budding astronauts will enjoy both the quick and silly trip and the dedicated way Wilma keeps her eye on the fly.

Sch++tte studied under Gerhard Richter, Benjamin Buchloh, and Bernd and Hilla Becher at the D++sseldorf Academy in the 1970s. He comes from that strong conceptual background, but as his career matured the emotional content of his work evolved and became much more potent. Sch++tte&#39;s work is incredibly eclectic: ceramic figures, architectural models, drawings, outdoor sculptures, photographs, and installations. A recent work, Big Spirits (1996), is a collection of larger-than-life-size aluminum figures that seem to be morphing before one&#39;s eyes. They are at once ghost, human, and machine. Also riveting is The Innocents (1994), a series of photographs of the heads of handmade figurines, and United Enemies, A Play in Ten Scenes (1993)--offset lithographs, also of figurines wrapped in Sch++tte&#39;s clothes. His watercolors are beautiful, ranging from drawings of fruit to portraits of women. Whatever the project, Sch++tte is tapped in to a particular humanity.Included in the book are essays by Julian Heynen and Angela Vettese, an interview with James Lingwood, and an essay by Roman philosopher Seneca, chosen by the artist. There is also a story by Sch++tte--printed in English for the first time. --Jennifer Cohen</p><p>Julian Heynen is Director of Exhibitions at the Krefeld Art Museums and presented Schutte&#39;s first museum show in 1986. Heynen writes extensively on modern and contemporary art. James Lingwood is a writer and curator of Schutte&#39;s first survey exhibition in Britain. He is Co-Director of Artangel, London, and his many publications include The Epic and the Everyday (1994), Rachel Whiteread&#39;s House (Phaidon, 1995) and Juan Munoz, Monologues and Dialogues (1996). Angela Vettese is a Milan-based critic and curator. She is Professor of Art History at the Carrera Academy in Bergamo. Her many catalogue texts include Piero Manzoni (1994) and John Cage (1993), and she is the author of Capire l&#39;artecontemporanea (1996).Text: German, English</p><h2>Dinosaurs - The Grand Tour: Everything Worth Knowing About Dinosaurs from Aardonyx to Zuniceratops</h2><p><b>A Main Selection of Scientific American Book Club<br><br> &#x201c;Remarkably all-encompassing and superbly illustrated . . . a fascinating tome.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Huffington Post</i><br><br> A visual trove of more than 300 dinosaurs, with key anatomy, geology, history, and theory at a glance</b><br><br> We live in a golden age of paleontological discovery&#x2014;the perfect time to dig in to the spectacular world of dinosaurs.

Just for the Fun of It!</h2><p>In journal format, tells the story of Hattie McNair&#39;s experiences and adventures in a South Carolina retirement home</p><p>Effie Leland Wilder has lived in Summerville, South Carolina for over fifty years, the last ten of the at the Presbyterian Home of Summerville. She gradutated from Converse College in 1930 and received the Distinguished Alumna Award in 1982. She also received the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest award, for her philanthropic work. Her work has been published in the Charleston News and Courier and in The Saturday Evening Post. <p> Laurie Allen Klein is a graduate of Maryville College in Tennessee. An illustrator and graphic artist, her work has appeared in Athens and Atlanta magazines and in Effie's other books. She lives in St. Augustine, Florida.</p>Once again proving that a zest for life doesn't necessarily diminish with age, 90-year-old Wilder (Out to Pasture; Over the Hill; Older but Wilder) returns to South Carolina's Fair Acres Retirement Home and her alter-ego Hattie McNair for more uplifting musings on the bittersweet complexities of aging. Like a merry Miss Marple, Hattie observes and comments on her fellow residents' travails with bright-eyed wit and clearheaded insight into the idiosyncrasies of human nature. Writing faithfully in her diary, Hattie spies humor and goodness all around her. A small boy finds redeeming friendship with a grieving widower, the residents' camaraderie lightens the burden of physical ailments and everyone has stories about the old South. While residents can't agree whether the "old days," with no air conditioning or washing machines, were better than modern times, with erring presidents and loosening morals, Hattie affirms that "laughing at tribulations seems much healthier than crying!" Despite degenerative eyesight, Hattie revels in everyday adventures, finding excitement even when the home is temporarily evacuated because of a nearby toxic spill. The book's warmest passages highlight the tender friendships and heartfelt compassion that turn age into wisdom, conveyed movingly when Hattie and her friends must decorate a Christmas tree with their memories. While Wilder's tone is refreshingly simple and straightforward, the plot is more anecdotal than plot-driven, and readers should overlook the scattered chronological order and enjoy the unsophisticated stories and hard-earned insights.

Yet the problem with doing foolish things was that it was quite often impossible to tell what was foolish and what wasn't until you'd swum too far out to turn back again. After that point, it was either carry on or drown.<br><br>Of course, you were hanged either way if another man stood up to accuse you of doing all manner of things you were relatively sure you hadn't. <br><br>And that was the thing about men: They could so easily change their minds, become frightened of what might happen to them, and throw you to the wolves. If you were very, very unlucky, they might even do all three. <br><br>At least&#x2014;if you were more than passably wealthy&#x2014;you might be able to go out in style. <br><br>I was waiting that morning for the footfalls I knew were coming. They were neither the trained, delicate rhythms of Our Lady's skilled professionals nor the uneven steps of sated patrons, but rather those that held all the surety and sharpness of a man of the law. The man who was coming for me was one who did not need to hunt his quarry because he knew very well where it would be. Though my offense was by all accounts a serious one, the way in which it must be handled would demand a touch of finesse. Most political matters did, though it was a philosophy lost on some men. <br>Despite my assumptions, I couldn't have said quite what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't the Provost of the city himself, leaning in the doorframe as though he hadn't a care in the world. <br><br>There was a large mirror hanging on the wall opposite the bed&#x2014;for people who liked that sort of thing, I supposed&#x2014;ornately framed in dark cherrywood. So I saw the scene as it must have appeared to him: the lines forming thin and faint at the corners of my eyes, gray hairs glinting at my temples more obviously than I'd have liked in the late- morning sun. I thought ruefully of how little I deserved those marks of age, and how well I had won them, for a man just past thirty-five years of age. Next to me the young man slept on, his tanned shoulders smooth, his mouth open and vulnerable. I tilted my head, fingers measuring the dark unkempt edges of the beard creeping over my cheeks and under my chin. <br><br>I'd not had the time to shave before&#x2014;and after, it had seemed like something of a trifle. After my betrayal by Erik, many things had seemed a trifle. <br><br>"Margrave Royston," said the Provost. "You're a hard man to track down." <br><br>"Not particularly," I said. <br><br>His nose wrinkled at the smell of burnt cloves that permeated the air, and I could sense how very badly he wished to tell me to stop smoking. His excellent comportment prevented him from doing so; or perhaps it was his keen attention to protocol. Nevertheless, there were those who believed the Esar had made a grievous error in letting a commoner enforce his laws. The Provost was a man of the Charlotte district, center-born and center-bred. The people liked him because he didn't put on airs, and everyone else liked him because he minded his own business&#x2014;with the exception, of course, of those rare occasions when the noblesse went out of their way to do something exceedingly imprudent or alarming; and then his intervention was required. <br><br>There was a bowl carved from black stone on the nightstand, in anticipation of the possibility that the wealthy patrons of Our Lady might need a place to put their cuff links or jewelry. I myself had adopted it as an ashtray, a purpose for which I felt it was peculiarly suited. <br><br>"You'd better get dressed," the Provost continued, removing a round, gold watch from his pocket. "There's a ruling to be had." <br><br>"So soon?" I didn't know myself whether the surprise in my voice was feigned or genuine. I decided on the third option, which was trousers, and got out of bed. "Dmitri, I must say the efficiency of this nation in condemning a man is simply astounding." <br><br>The Provost continued to examine his pocket watch with somewhat forced interest. "Your duties within the Basquiat will be assumed by another, in accordance with the sentencing." <br><br>"Sentencing?" I caught a glimpse of myself again in the mirror, hair dark and sleep-wild, half-dressed, white shirt voluminous and untucked, my nose stark and sharp and the new lines tight around my eyes and mouth. I'd lost my cuff links under a mound of ash. I looked exactly as I felt: a man thrown off center.<br><br>"Oh. There's no official trial," Dmitri said quickly, casting a glance upward. Finding me more or less decent, he nodded and tucked the watch away into some invisible pocket. "We just thought it might be time for a little, ah, chat." <br><br>His attitude confirmed my worst fears.<br><br>We stepped outside together, and I looked about at the city I loved. <br><br>Our Lady of a Thousand Fans was situated in the heart of Miranda. Most will tell you it's the palace, or even the Basquiat, that's the real center of the city's uppermost district. In truth, it all depends on where you're coming from, or what attracts you most. <br><br>You can tell a lot about people by the details they choose to employ when describing Volstov's capital.<br><br>If you ask anybody who's anybody, though, they'll tell you that if you wish to get through the city and not end up hopelessly lost, it isn't at the palace or Our Lady that you want to begin. Leaving from the Basquiat is actually easiest, taking the Whitstone Road, which leads in a counterclockwise direction through 'Versity Stretch, past the Rue d'St. Difference and its countless milliners&#x2014;elaborate hats being very much in fashion this season, the sort with lace veils, wide brims, and feathers&#x2014;along with all the other shops. The Rue is just on the edge between lower Miranda and upper Charlotte, so once you're past the merchants' quarter you're smack in the middle of Charlotte herself, teeming and fat-voweled and cocky. No one much cares what you do in Charlotte so long as you're not doing it to a friend or member of the family. Once you accustom yourself to Charlotte's indifference, she will adopt you as her son or daughter, so long as you look after yourself and don't stray too close to Mollyedge.<br><br>It was a principle that could be applied to any of the three sister districts, for each had its own boundaries, as well as its own consequences for dealing with those who strayed too close to them. <br>The Provost's hansom had windows, at least, and for that I was thankful. I had the odd idea in my head&#x2014;pervasive no matter how I tried to distract myself&#x2014;that this might be the last time I got to examine the city I so loved with such reverent attention. I'd had the same feeling with Erik the last occasion I'd met with him, though at the time I hadn't paid my misgivings much mind. <br><br>In the end I didn't blame Erik. Volstov was accepting of such dalliances, while Arlemagne took the opposite approach. And Erik was an Arlemagne prince. He was under edict, and he did no credit to his royal family nor to the time-honored tradition of diplomacy for which Arlemagne was famous. On top of all that, we hadn't exactly been careful&#x2014;a fact for which I blamed myself&#x2014;making eyes at one another in broad daylight, in the streets, in the middle of the Basquiat. My only surprise was that no one had noticed us sooner. <br><br>If I were being ruthless in my honesty, I would admit that it was not the only surprise I had felt over the matter, but I had told myself it was pointless to wrestle with such thoughts beyond what good they could do me. Arlemagne had no understanding of Talents: a magician's particular aptitude within a given field. The same man who could pull a stream from its bed could not create enough heat to boil water unless he did it the same as the rest of us, with a stove, or by building a fire with his own two hands.<br><br>Likewise, a man whose skills lay chiefly with combustion would have to rely on his own considerable charm, rather than his Talent, to seduce any sort of prince.<br><br>Erik had capitalized on the ignorance of his countrymen and saved himself a great deal of grief in doing so. Really, it should not have surprised me. He was boundlessly clever; one almost wanted to admire him.<br><br>Now, in the absence of what regret I'd not yet allowed myself to feel, I felt an overwhelming sense of loss concerning Thremedon City herself, her twisting uneven skyline and its gentle sloping toward the sea. <br><br>We jostled around a corner, the Provost staring at his watch with the keen interest of a man determined not to be late or one who was extremely uncomfortable with the situation at hand. From the fervor he was devoting to the task, I had to assume that, wherever we were heading, it was certain to be a room full of self-important men, waiting to decide my fate. I normally had nothing against self-importance, but the idea that, at this moment, someone could be settling a sentence upon my head was both disquieting and invasive, as though the private events of my life had all too quickly become public. <br><br>I might have considered this fact before involving myself with Arlemagne's heir, but I have always been much cleverer in retrospect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>There were certain freedoms allowed to men of the Basquiat&#x2014;men of privilege and wealth. I wondered if this would help my case. But there were some limits to that freedom for which one couldn't be pardoned. I'd never been at the center of an international incident before. On the periphery, perhaps&#x2014;skirting around the edges like the proper young madames keen on avoiding puddles in the street&#x2014;but this time was different. Displease the wrong people, and even your connections can't save you. Displease the wrong country, and&#x2014;well, I would find out shortly. <br>I refused to blame Erik. Panic was a natural reaction; it could make you stupid, selfish. I'd seen it often enough. It was a rare man who had the natural proclivity to do the right thing when the wrong one might save him a share in the punishment or blame. Erik had been young. In his place and at that age, I might well have done the same.<br><br>This was a lie&#x2014;I knew even as I thought it&#x2014;but it was a lie that gave me some comfort.<br><br>Our carriage halted in front of the Esar's palace: a long, low-ceilinged building of cream and gold. The Provost got out before me and held the carriage door, so I knew that things couldn't be so dire as all that. Still, it was with a sense of slow, settling disaster that I stepped onto the Palace Walk. <br>For the first time in a long while I felt utterly powerless to shape my surroundings. <br><br>"It's this way," said the Provost. He tapped me once on the shoulder, then took the lead. I followed him, for I could go no other way. <br><br><i><br>Rook<br></i><br>The only reason we got punished the way we did was 'cause th'Esar was spitting mad for too many reasons that had nothing to do with me and what I'd done. All of a sudden and out of nowhere, we were getting slapped with a ruler on the wrist, only there was a whole lot more of a ruckus about it, and it was th'Esar himself instead of some prissy-pants schoolma'am doing the slapping. I mean, we were all called in&#x2014;me and the rest of the boys&#x2014;and lined up on these uncomfortable chairs that smelled of old velvet and dust, and made to wait in this place Balfour (his voice reminding us he'd been raised with all the privileges of a thoroughbred bitch) said was Punishment's Antechamber. And even I had to admit it: That seemed about right. Nobody said anything to us, just gave us a couple of dark looks before making us wait, no doubt so we could think long and hard about what we'd done. They were scowling at me in particular, seeing as how I'd been the one to do it, and everyone knew. <br><br>I wasn't sorry. None of the boys were, either&#x2014;I could see it in the way they were scowling right back. Th'Esar was just pissed and looking for someone to blame it all on. Because we were having enough trouble with Arlemagne without all this on top of the rest, Ghislain'd said, and Adamo'd just shook his head like maybe he wished he'd been a part of it and maybe he was real glad he hadn't been, and maybe it didn't matter either way since he was called in for it with the rest of us. <br><br>The thing was, I didn't know she was married. <br><br>She wasn't so fine and so sweet-curved as I couldn't've found somebody else&#x2014;and better&#x2014;to tickle that night. But she was married to a diplomat, which was what made it so bad, so when I tried to pay her like she was a common whore, she got wild as a wet cat on me, screaming and throwing things and breaking vases. I thought she was a whore, the way she'd tarted herself up, but apparently that was just an Arlemagne's way: powder on everything and too many undergarments, the kind of teasing frippery you only see in Our Lady and which I normally don't have time for. Her breasts were incredible, though&#x2014;big and round and soft and warm&#x2014;and I spent a lot of time letting her know how incredible I thought they were. Even if I did think it was a commercial exchange, she might've been grateful instead of screaming rape all over, like that's what you can do if you're a woman when things go sour and you feel a slight. <br><br>She called me all kinds of things in her raw-edged Arlemagne voice, all kinds of incredible things I passed on afterward to Magoughin, who collected that kind of talk. But then all of a sudden there was a diplomat with some ridiculous mustache knocking down our door like he was going to kill us, and I almost had my knife in him, all the boys laughing and whooping it up, when Adamo got his arms round me and dragged me off, both of us cursing up a storm.</p><h2>Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies</h2><p>This lyrical biography explores the life and art of Yoko Ono, from her childhood haiku to her avant-garde visual art and experimental music.

The broad facts are freely available around the Web, but here they've been organized roughly chronologically and presented in context with descriptions of works that presaged movements in music as well as visual and performance art. Divided into sections representing different life stages, the detailed narrative includes helpful historical background for modern teens and is written in a lively, often colloquial style. Endpapers with the words "Imagine Peace" in the 24 languages in which they are carved on the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland will remind readers of two major themes of Ono's life. The book is liberally illustrated with photographs, but it will take a stretch of readers' own imaginations to understand just how ground- and taboo-breaking her art and life have been. The back matter includes a bibliography that reflects the authors' extensive research, which included an interview with the subject.

By the author of A Clockwork Orange. 30,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Anthony Burgess was born in Manchester in 1917. He served in the army from 1940 to 1954 before becoming a colonial education officer. It was while he held this post that doctors told him he would die, and he decided to try to live by writing. A prolific and respected author, Burgess died in 1993.Burgess's last book, published in England two years ago, shortly before the author's death, is a masterly piece of work. It is an extraordinary reflection on the state of American publishing that the novel had to wait so long for publication here, and then be brought out only by a small but enterprising company like Carroll &amp; Graf. Like Burgess's Nothing Like the Sun 30 years ago (arguably the finest novel ever written about Shakespeare), this volume reflects the author's magical sense of language and his deep immersion in the Elizabethan ethos. The story of the short life of brilliant young playwright Christopher Marlowe is ostensibly told by an actor of the time; so perfectly is the period voice caught that it is hard to believe the novelist was not transcribing contemporary documents. Marlowe is seen as a student at Cambridge, soon caught up in the life of a secret agent, shuttling between England and France as the religious struggles of the time reach their apex in the slaying of Mary Queen of Scots. Himself a skeptic, and an active homosexual (frolicking with the young heir of the powerful Earl of Walsingham), Marlowe manages for several risky years to keep his head above the sectarian waters, working when he can at his plays, ever after "the mighty line." Then some of his fellow conspirators, suspicious of him, fabricate a brawl on a spring evening in a tavern and he is slain, still in his 20s. Burgess's command of his material is absolute; he wrote his student thesis, he tells us, on Marlowe and brings a lifetime's linguistic and fictional gifts to this headlong, shining, cruel portrait of a terrifying-but posthumously glorious-age. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Freedom Tools: For Overcoming Life&#39;s Tough Problems</h2><p>Most Christians feel ill-equipped when trying to help each other-yet it is within their power to make a difference.

Asian cuisine is so different, yet so appealing, to the western palate, that we make it a cornerstone of our tasting experience. </p><p> While we know that shrimps bok choi and sprouts are among the distinctive elements of Asian cooking, the sauces that make dishes special are a mystery to many Western chefs. They are widely available in Asian shops, supermarket specialty food sections, and by mail order. But the bottles are often labeled in Chinese or Vietnamese characters. Even labels in English don't actually describe the tastes or uses of the special sauces that we would like to use - but may be reluctant to buy. </p><p> <b>Asian Sauces and Marinades</b> unlocks this mystery of the orient. It is the key to the pungent, aromatic and richly spiced sauces that are easy to obtain and use to make the rich and complex flavors that are authentic and satisfying. It contains: </p><ul> <li></li>An 8-page glossary of terms, from Annato to Hoi Sin to Sambal Oeleek <li></li>Marinades for fish, meat, poultry and tofu <li></li>Stir-fry sauces and techniques <li></li>Dressings and pickling sauces for vegetables and fruits <li></li>Dipping sauces and relishes <li></li>Rubs and glazes for meat and seafood <li></li>Stews and braised dishes <li></li>Curries, mild to fiery <li></li>Soups, broths and stocks <li></li>Sauces as accompaniments <li></li>Dessert sauces. </ul><p></p><p> Each section is filled with familiar and unusual recipes (80 in total) that are uniquely associated with the sauces and marinades described. There is a history of the dish and the national cuisine and dozens of very tempting full-color photographs of the dishes described. </p><p> There is a great need for the information in this book, and Wendy Sweetser presents it in a form and style that is inviting and accessible to Western cook, from novice to experienced. </p><blockquote> "All great chefs agree that the secret to delicious dishes is the sauce. This volume does a superb job of showing you how fundamental they are in Asian cooking and explains their many uses. Having this book in your collection is like having a magic wand in your kitchen."<br> <b>- Chef Martin Yan,<br> - host of <i>Yan Can Cook</i></b> </blockquote></p><p><p> <b>Wendy Sweetser</b> specializes in food and travel writing. Traveling in Asia for 25 years, she got to know local cuisine firsthand by touring markets and food stalls. Recently, she has spent several years working with a leading Asian food company developing recipes and new products. </p>Introduction: Asian sauces and marinades <p>It is not surprising that Asia, home to around half the world's population, has produced some of the most diverse, exciting and inspirational cuisines in the world. When Asian people sit down to eat, they are not simply satisfying a craving for food. They are celebrating something even more fundamental to their culture and way of life -- the ritual and pleasure of sharing food with family and friends. </p><p>-- </p><p>At the heart of Asian cooking are the sauces and marinades that are integral to so many of its dishes. Pungent and richly spiced, aromatic with fresh herbs and fruit, sour with tamarind, or fired with the intense heat of chiles, every sauce is a complex and subtle masterpiece in its own right. Add to that the age-old custom of mothers handing down carefully guarded recipes to their daughters, never writing anything down or sharing their culinary secrets beyond the family, and the seemingly inscrutable puzzle that is Oriental cooking begins to deepen. </p><p>The aim of this book is to show that it is possible to unlock the secrets of Asian cuisines and that by a careful blend of ingredients and an understanding of the techniques that are used in Oriental cooking, you can create authentic Asian dishes in your own kitchen. Most of the ingredients called for in the recipes can be bought in supermarkets -- more unusual ones can be tracked down in specialty stores or markets, or brought home as exciting culinary souvenirs from holidays to the East. </p><p>Although similar ingredients feature in cuisines all over Asia, different countries favor their own individual variations, either in the texture of soy sauce, the "heat" of curry paste, the saltiness of shrimp paste, or the pungency of fish sauce. It is these delicate differences and the manner in which ingredients are combined that make each individual Oriental cuisine unique. </p><p>External influences have also left their mark on the melting pot of Asia's cultures, its peoples, and, by extension, its cooking. Baguettes on sale in a Vietnamese market are a reminder of French colonial rule in Indochina. The Dutch introduced Indonesians to desserts and cakes, the Spanish added olive oil, tomatoes, olives and paella to Filipino kitchens, and Nyonya cuisine developed when the Chinese traders in Melaka and Singapore settled there and married Malay wives. </p><p>One of the defining flavors of Asian cooking is chile. This fruit of the capsicum plant grows prolifically all over the region and its liberal use, particularly in Thai, Indonesian, and Korean dishes, can make some recipes too hot for Western palates unaccustomed to such heat. There are hundreds of chile varieties and, as a general rule, heat can be measured in reverse proportion to size: the smaller the chile, the hotter it will be. This book approaches the quantity of chiles to be used in recipes with caution but, as with good wine, individual taste will dictate. If a recipe sounds too hot, cut the chiles down to suit your palate. You can always increase the amount next time, since you may well be surprised at how addictive chiles can become! </p><p>Asian cookery writers often compare the merits of a good meal with those of a good novel in that it must start well, have character and suspense, and follow through to a memorable finish. If this book can tempt you to discover more of the wonderful secrets of Asian cooking, a whole continent of evocative flavors and aromas is here to be explored and enjoyed in your own home. </p><p>As they say in China, chin, chin-ch'e.

Both native New Yorkers and tourists have played hard in Gotham for centuries, lindy hopping in 1930s Harlem, voguing in 1980s Chelsea, and refueling at all-night diners and bars. The slim island at the mouth of the Hudson River is packed with places of leisure and entertainment, but Manhattan's infamously fast pace of change means that many of these beautifully constructed and incredibly ornate buildings have disappeared, and with them a rich and ribald history.<br>Yet with David Freeland as a guide, it's possible to uncover skeletons of New York's lost monuments to its nightlife. With a keen eye for architectural detail, Freeland opens doors, climbs onto rooftops, and gazes down alleyways to reveal several of the remaining hidden gems of Manhattan's nineteenth- and twentieth-century entertainment industry. From the Atlantic Garden German beer hall in present-day Chinatown to the city's first motion picture studio&#x2014;Union Square's American Mutoscope and Biograph Company&#x2014;to the Lincoln Theater in Harlem, Freeland situates each building within its historical and social context, bringing to life an old New York that took its diversions seriously. Freeland reminds us that the buildings that serve as architectural guideposts to yesteryear's recreations cannot be re-created&#x2014;once destroyed they are gone forever. With condominiums and big box stores spreading over city blocks like wildfires, more and more of the Big Apple's legendary houses of mirth are being lost. By excavating the city's cultural history, this delightful book unearths some of the many mysteries that lurk around the corner and lets readers see the city in a whole new light.</p></p><p><b>David Freeland</b> is a writer who specializes in music history and popular culture.

In <b>Joseph Smith</b>, he employs his keen insight and rich storytelling gift to explore one of the period's major figures. The most important reformer and innovator in American religious history, Joseph Smith has remained a fascinating enigma to many both inside and outside the Mormon Church he founded.<p></p><p>Born in 1805, Smith grew up during the "Second Great Awakening," when secular tumult had spawned radical religious fervor and countless new sects. His contemplative nature and soaring imagination&#x2014;the first of his many visions occurred at the age of fourteen&#x2014;were nurtured in the close, loving family created by his deeply devout parents. His need to lead and be recognized was met by his mission as God's vehicle for a new faith and by the hundreds who, magnetized by his charm and charismatic preaching, gave rise to the Mormon Church. Remini brings Smith into unprecedented focus and contextualizes his enduring contribution to American life and culture within the distinctive characteristics of an extraordinary age.</p><p></p></p><p>In 1820, a tall New York teenager received a vision from two angels, warning him that all existing churches were corrupt abominations and that "he must join none of them." So Joseph Smith founded the Mormon church.<p> Robert Remini, the noted biographer of Andrew Jackson and historian of the Jacksonian era, locates Smith and the origins of the Mormon faith in the heady early-nineteenth-century epoch of religious evangelicalism. None of the many new sects and creeds that came out of that period has enjoyed the success of Smith's church, Remini notes. None has undergone the same intense degree of persecution, either, provoked by Smith's quest for secular political power and "such teachings as polygamy, eternal matter, baptism of the dead, a plurality of gods, men and women becoming gods themselves, [and] God the Father being once a man who passed through a stage of mortality before becoming God"--teachings that inspired charges of heresy, and that, in the end, cost Joseph Smith his life in what Remini calls an act of political assassination.</p><p> Remini delivers a nuanced, highly readable portrait of the controversial leader, one that sheds light on his time and beliefs and emphasizes his "striking human qualities." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Robert V.

He lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of biologically based neurodevelopmental disorders that affect children&#39;s behavior and social and communication skills. Public awareness of autism and Asperger syndrome, two ASDs, has led to an increase in diagnoses, with approximately 1% of American children exhibiting symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Despite all the interest and attention, it is still difficult to determine whether a child has an ASD, since the conditions are complex and vary widely, and that is precisely why a parent with questions and concerns needs a reliable, authoritative resource. Edited by Rosenblatt and Carbone, two autism specialists, one of whom has a child with autism, and with contributions from nine physicians and eleven parents, this book provides up-to-date information and much compassion as it leads parents through the process of understanding ASDs and their possible causes; how to recognize symptoms; different behavioral and developmental treatments; the role of medication and alternative/complementary medicine; forming a partnership with the pediatrician; finding community support and care; and how to become a child&#39;s advocate and why one needs to. This book will help parents and their children learn about and face the challenges of living with autism-related conditions. While less personal than Lynn Kern Koegel&#39;s and Claire LaZebnik&#39;s Overcoming Austism and Growing Up on the Spectrum, this volume presents vital facts and figures and an excellent overview of ASDs, an ideal introductory handbook for parents, educators, and caregivers.

The idea of a spherical world had been widely accepted in educated circles from as early as the fourth century b.c.

This proves both that the earth is spherical and that its periphery is not large, for otherwise such a small change of position could not have had such an immediate effect.&nbsp;<br>ARISTOTLE, <i>On the Heavens</i> (Book II, 350 BC)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>BEYOND THE FAIRYTALE LAND of heroes and villains and momentous conflicts between truth and falsehood on an individual, cultural and conceptual scale, flat-earth belief can be traced back to some of the most ancient civilizations in world history. The first of these are the Sumerians and Babylonians, who inhabited Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates (the site of modern Iraq) from <i>c</i>. 4500 to 500 BC. Although these peoples left texts describing a range of cosmological theories - too many to speak of a single, overarching Mesopotamian world-view - they developed the idea of a tripartite universe, with the earth as a flatsurface ruled by the god Enlil, sandwiched between the sky and the underworld. For the Egyptians, the same triple-decker arrangement applied, with the sky resting on four pillars, forked poles or mountain peaks rising from the corners of the flat earth beneath. While the Egyptian system differed in detail from the Sumero-Babylonian world-view, it too personified natural phenomena, representing the earth as the earth-god, Geb, lying outstretched to create the plane. The sky, meanwhile, was the goddess Nut, mother of the sun-god Re, who was depicted as a giant standing cow or a young woman arched over the earth like a canopy. And so the situation remained; while later Egyptians made voyages to the so-called land of Punt, thought to be along the coast of East Africa, and other evidence suggests that they circumnavigated the continent, such experiences had no impact on ideas about the shape of the earth. This being the case, in the eyes of the oldest civilizations for which we have records, whether in the form of Babylonian clay tablets or Egyptian papyri, the earth continued to be a flat surface of a circular or rectangular shape.1It remained the same for the ancient Hebrews, who were flanked by the Egyptians to the south-west and the Sumero-Babylonians to the north-east, and whose cosmology resembled the assumptions of their powerful neighbours about the form of the earth. In terms of cosmology and creation, the Old Testament owes much to Mesopotamian mythology, which has led to claims that the Bible is a 'flat-earth book'.2 Although the scriptures do contain disparate passages relating to cosmology they are not a systematic study of the heavens, however, rendering any presentation of a Biblical world-view a patchwork of statements scattered through books written over several centuries. Nevertheless, it had been claimed that the Bible presents a reasonably clear and consistent view of a tiered universe based on the Sumero-Babylonian model. In this system, the cosmos consists of the vault of heaven <i>(shamayim),</i> or 'firmament', containing the sun, moon and stars (Genesis 1:14-17). The Bible teaches that these heavenly bodies move across the stationary earth (Psalms 19:1-7), while the firmamentrests on pillars or mountains (Job 26:11) rooted in the flat earth below. Beneath the earth lies the underworld, <i>Sheol</i>, seen as the abode of the dead (Numbers 16:28-34; I Samuel 28:13-15; Isaiah 14:9-11; Ecclesiastes 9:10). The earth, which is generally depicted as an immovable disc or 'circle' (Job 26:10), supported on water (Psalms 24:2) or in empty space (Job 26:7), is bordered by a protective barrier, probably a mountain range. As for its shape, it is generally spoken of as a flat disc, so that if one travelled far enough one would eventually arrive at the 'ends of the earth' (Deuteronomy 13:8, 28:64; Isaiah 5:26; Psalms 135:7). Within this scheme, the four corners of the earth (Isaiah 11:12, Ezekiel 7:2) might refer to distant regions, unless taken literally, when the earth could be considered rectangular or square.3Flat-earth belief was also prevalent in Ancient Greece, details of which are provided in the writings of Aristotle (384-22 BC), who had a habit of reviewing his predecessors' opinions as a precursor to demolishing them with his own. His cosmological treatise <i>On the Heavens</i> (350 BC) provides a useful, if polemical, survey of opinions dating from Thales, the Ionian geometer, astronomer and engineer (<i>c.</i> 625-<i>c</i>. 547 BC), in the sixth century BC.4 The first speculative thinker of the Ionian school, he believed the earth was a circular disc floating like a piece of wood on the world (meaning universe) ocean, while his pupil or younger associate, Anaximander (<i>c.</i> 611-<i>c</i>. 545 BC), argued that the earth was a cylindrical column floating upright in air in the centre of the universe. According to Aristotle, Anaximander believed that this column was three times as broad as it was high with humankind inhabiting the flat uppermost surface.5Meanwhile, the third philosopher of the Ionian school, Anaximenes (c. 585-525 BC), is reputed to have believed that the heavenly bodies were flat, and likely thought the same of the earth, although the precise details of his view remain unknown. Indeed, when dealing with pre-Socratic thinkers - each of whom seemed to design his own cosmological system but left no writings - we are reliant on fragments for clues about a number of complexviews. Yet in terms of who knew what, when and how, the Ionian school has been credited with being the first to practise a broadly philosophical and naturalistic way of looking at the world; that is to say, they began to ask a new range of questions about nature in terms of its phenomena, its composition and the way that it worked. Thales and Anaximander began to think of the world as an orderly, unitary whole that was worth investigating for its own sake, beyond its role as the realm of gods, and they looked further than Zeus and his cohorts for explanations about the way things worked. Here, then, are traces of the beginnings of what we now know as 'science' and 'philosophy', although religion and astrology continued to play a central role in and around new lines of enquiry, meaning that shifts were exceedingly gradual and sporadic. The same may be said of the development of ideas concerning the shape of the earth.6It was not until the late sixth century BC that the flat-earth thinking that had dominated world-views for several millennia was to take a more radical turn through the teachings of the Pythagoreans. A much-mythologized philosophical school, it was based at the other extremity of the Greek world from the Ionians, in the thriving city of Croton in what is now southern Italy. Its leader, Pythagoras (582-500 BC), the most famous mathematician in Ancient Greece, was the son of a silversmith and gem engraver and later a pupil of Thales and Anaximander at Miletus. Having travelled in Babylonia and Egypt, at some time around 530 BC, Pythagoras settled at Croton where he established the Pythagorean brotherhood, a large, close-knit religious community that held extensive political power in its hometown and the surrounding area, Magna Graecia (Greek-governed southern Italy). While Pythagoras appears to have been a visionary who, according to Athenian philosopher Plato (<i>c</i>. 427-<i>c</i>. 347 BC), taught a whole way of life, in the absence of writings it is impossible to extricate his ideas from those of his followers in a school of thought that was bound by confidentiality and which undoubtedly developed its doctrines over something in the region of two centuries. Amongan abundance of ideas that have been ascribed to the Pythagoreans or Pythagoras himself are a focus on purification and the practice of silence, the belief in a mystical union with all living things and the immortality and transmigration of the soul, along with a veto on various activities, including leaving a cooking pot's imprint visible in the ashes of a fire and standing on one's own toenail clippings. Best known, however, is Pythagoras's teaching that number lies at the heart of all things; it is the realm of eternal perfection and absolutes of which all things are composed. The contemplation of geometrical forms and patterns was believed to allow the mind to surpass the earthly appearance of reality and engender a connection to the divine, although again there is no certainty about exactly what Pythagorean number-related teaching involved.7 As a whole, Pythagorean philosophy seemed to be based on a vision of mystical unity in nature, with number at the root of all things, from the theorem governing right-angled triangles (the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides) to those governing rhythm and acoustics in music- the connection between the pitch of a note, for example, and the length of a string.In a religious world-view based on numbers and measurement, shapes and sizes, patterns and unity, heavenly movements and the shape of the earth were obvious sources of interest as natural manifestations of the divine. It has been suggested that Pythagoras learned the basics of his astronomy and mathematics from his travels in 'the East', but whatever the case, when it comes to ideas about the shape of the earth, a feature at the heart of traditional histories of science is entirely bypassed. While Pythagoras, or the Pythagoreans, are generally credited with being the first to argue that the earth is a globe (although doubtless someone suggested the idea before), it is ironic that the name of the first individual 'discoverer' of one of the most basic scientific facts is a mystery. All that can be said is that the Pythagoreans believed that the earth was a globe floating freely in space because the sphere was the perfect shape. In addition, it is impossible to say how readily thisdoctrine was accepted outside their school, in educated circles or through society as a whole. Importantly, post-Pythagorean philosophers, most notably Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (497-428 BC) and the atomists Leucippus of Miletus (fl. 440) and Democritus of Abdera (<i>c</i>. 460 BC-<i>c</i>. 370 BC), were still arguing that the earth was disc- or drum-shaped in the fifth century BC.8 That said, Pythagorean speculations brought into play the idea of a spherical earth and were to have a profound influence on Plato. By the time his pupil Aristotle was writing, later in the fourth century BC, the globe concept seems to have become widely accepted among educated people.In this way, the three-tiered earth, heaven and underworld system of Near Eastern cultures gradually faded from view, replaced by visions of a spherical earth and an all-encompassing sky. Undoubtedly, changing perceptions were bolstered by practical, cultural and environmental factors, particularly that the Ancient Greek world was surrounded by sea. It has been suggested that the culture's consequent geographical knowledge and maritime experience may have triggered the switch from the world-view prevalent in the literal and metaphorical flatlands of Babylonia and Egypt.9 Certainly Aristotle invoked the proof of ships disappearing over the horizon, hull before masts, along with the earth's circular shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse and the different appearance of stars when viewed from different latitudes, to support the contention that the earth was a globe in his book <i>On the Heavens</i>. The mainstream consensus, all of the renowned Greek writers, from Plato to Eudoxus (<i>c</i>. 375 BC), Euclid (<i>c</i>. 300 BC), Aristarchus (<i>c</i>. 310-230 BC) and Archimedes (287-212 BC), accepted a globular earth, while Aristotle's geocentric cosmology - centring on an immobile sphere at the centre of the universe with the planets moving around it in perfect concentric circles - was to dominate Western cosmological thinking until the work of Copernicus and Galileo nineteen centuries later.10With consensus reached on the shape of the earth, focus shifted to estimating its size. By the fourth century BC, Aristotle reports,efforts had already been made to calculate the circumference - perhaps by the different positions of the stars when viewed from different latitudes - which had resulted in the oldest existing estimate at 400,000 stadia. If a stade is taken to be <i>c</i>. 500 feet (a moot point because measurements were not standardized), this would give a figure of 39,000 or 40,000 miles at the equator.11 Further estimates followed and by the third century BC we have details of an experiment to measure the globe's diameter. The test was undertaken by the Greek polymath, Eratosthenes (<i>c</i>. 276-<i>c</i> . 194 BC), director of the famous library in the museum of Alexandria, then the Egyptian capital and centre of Hellenistic culture and learning. Essentially, he is said to have noticed that at noon on the summer solstice the sun was directly overhead at Syene (present-day Aswan) because a vertical pointer cast no shadow and the sun's rays shone to the bottom of a deep well. At the same time in Alexandria, which Eratosthenes believed to be 5000 stadia (approximately 530 miles) due north, the sun made an angle equivalent to one-fiftieth of a circle or 7.2 degrees to the vertical. Assuming that the sun's rays are basically parallel, Eratosthenes then used geometry to calculate the earth's circumference to 250,000 stadia, possibly somewhere in the region of 29,000 miles.12 Although there were flaws in Eratosthenes's data, and the exact length of a stade, or stadium, is unknown, his estimate for the earth's circumference is not far from the present-day value of approximately 24,860 miles.Mathematicians continued to estimate the size of the earth, while they also focused on cracking a puzzle on a much larger scale: explaining their geocentric vision of the universe, or how the planets moved around the central, immovable and, of course, spherical earth. In the second century, the theories and findings of six centuries of astronomical research were finally drawn together by the Greek geographer, mathematician and astronomer Claudius Ptolemy (<i>c</i>. 130-75), in his encyclopedic compilation of ancient knowledge <i>Syntaxis,</i> commonly known by its Arabic name <i>Almagest</i> or 'the greatest'. Compiled from the archives of the library atAlexandria, where Eratosthenes had earlier been based, the book's name was fitting indeed, for the theories of <i>Almagest</i> remained the mainstream for Arabic and Latin civilizations until set aside in favour of the heliocentric, or sun-centred, solar system proposed by Copernicus in the mid-sixteenth century. The Ptolemaic system was essentially a more complex version of the Aristotelian system, with adjustments to account for variations in the observed distances of the planets from the earth. By late antiquity, the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic system of circles and spheres, cycles and epicycles, dominated perceptions of the heavens, with a static spherical earth placed in the centre. Moreover, in common with Aristotle, Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i> provided a number of 'sensible' (sense-related) proofs for why the earth must be this shape.13With the earth established as spherical for a number of centuries, the question becomes the survival and dissemination of the idea. Although factors surrounding the gradual disintegration of the Roman Empir...</p><h2>Textile Techniques in Metal: For Jewelers Textile Artists &amp; Sculptors</h2><p>Perhaps Arline Fisch can&#39;t teach readers how to spin straw into gold, but she can show them how to weave with silver, knit with brass, crochet with copper, and braid with gold of various hues. With step-by-step instructions and how-to photos, she explains how to work each fiber technique in metal wire or strip. Each technique is illustrated with examples of handsome jewelry by accomplished designers.</p><p>Arline M. Fisch, Professor of Art Emerita at San Diego State University, is an artist and jeweler working primarily in precious metals. She exhibits work nationally and internationally. Her work melds jewelry, sculpture, and clothing, and she incorporates the structure of textiles and fiber craft into metal-based pieces that are often inspired by ancient cultures and the natural world. Fisch is the recipient of numerous honors, including an honorary doctorate from Skidmore; a gold medal from the American Craft Council; the Lifetime Achievement Award in Crafts from the National Museum of Women in the Arts; and multiple Fulbright fellowships. Her work is represented in numerous museum and private collections.Weaving and knitting may not seem to be likely techniques for metalworkers, but fine wire and strips of metal can be made pliable enough to be worked this way. Fisch gives detailed instructions for metal weaving, knitting, crocheting, braiding, lacemaking, and basketry. A section of historical examples and a pictorial survey of works by contemporary artists is included.

Still grieving for the family he lost to the plaque, he lives only for his arcane craft. But an imperial summons from Valerius the Trakesian to Sarantium, the most magnificent place in the world, is difficult to resist.</p><p>In a world half-wild and tangled with magic, a journey to Sarantium means a walk into destiny. Bearing with him a deadly secret and a Queen's seductive promise, guarded only by his own wits and a talisman from an alchemist's treasury, Crispin sets out for the fabled city. Along the way he will encounter a great beast from the mythic past,and in robbing the <em>zubir</em> of its prize he wins a woman's devotion and a man's loyalty--and loses a gift he didn't know he had until it was gone.</p><p>Once in this city ruled by intrigue and violence, he must find his own source of power. Struggling to deal with the dangers and seductive lures of the men and woman around him, Crispin does discover it, in a most unusual place--high on the scaffolding of the greatest artwork ever imagined....</p></p><p><i>Sailing to Sarantium</i> is a small story. Its hero, Crispin, is unassuming as heroes go. He's a skilled mosaicist, an artist who makes pictures with decorative tiles, and responds to a request from a distant emperor to travel to the imperial capital and work on the new sanctuary there. Hardly the makings of high adventure. But then again, Guy Gavriel Kay could write about a peasant going to pick up a pail of water and you'd probably hang on every word.<p> If you don't know Kay, you should. His pedigree is impeccable, starting with a well-loved fantasy debut, the Fionavar Tapestry trilogy (<i>The Summer Tree</i>, <i>The Wandering Fire</i>, and <i>The Darkest Road</i>), and a compilation he did with Christopher Tolkien called <i>The Silmarillion</i>. <i>Sailing to Sarantium</i>, the first half of the Sarantine Mosaic series, evokes his other historical fantasy titles, such as <i>A Song for Arbonne</i> and <i>The Lions of Al-Rassan</i>, and is a well-researched analog to the Byzantine Empire and fifth-century Europe--with all its political and religious machinations.</p><p> Despite its seemingly prosaic cast and quest, <i>Sailing to Sarantium</i> is a charmer, another Kay classic. As usual, the character descriptions are subtle and precise--the mosaicist, Crispin, is a shrewd, irascible, and intensely likable man who is fiercely devoted to his art but troubled by guilt and loss. Reluctantly surrendering to events, he agrees to travel to Sarantium to work for the emperor. ("Sailing to Sarantium," we learn, is an expression synonymous with embracing great change.) As Crispin moves from roadside quarrels to palace intrigue, Kay gracefully shifts perspective from character to character, moving forward and backward in time and giving a rich sense of the world through the eyes of soldiers, slaves, and senators. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is acknowledged as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost fantasy authors.

Among the sixty-plus anthologies he has edited are <i>Legends</i> and <i>Far Horizons,</i> which contain original short stories set in the most popular universe of Robert Jordan, Stephen King, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, and virtually every other bestselling fantasy and SF writer today. Mr. Silverberg's Majipoor Cycle, set on perhaps the grandest and greatest world ever imagined, is considered one of the jewels in the crown of speculative fiction.<p></p>In Hugo and Nebula winner Silverberg's epic alternative history, as grandly sweeping and imaginative as his celebrated Majipoor Cycle (Lord Valentine's Castle, etc.), the imperial Eternal City (aka Roma) takes 2,000 years to decline but not quite fall. Starting with a scholar's recollection of a failed Hebrew exodus from Egypt centuries earlier, this unusually moving novel depicts 10 crucial historical moments, each centering on the personality of a fictional emperor seen through the eyes of an engaging lesser figure, like an imperial bureaucrat, a luscious and wealthy widow, a brave legionary commander, a conscientious architect, a hunky son of a Celtic chieftain, or even barbarian children who unwittingly bring down the last emperor. Silverberg seamlessly interpolates glimpses of Rome's real history in this handsomely crafted fiction, whether looking back to the ideals of the ancient Republic-duty, honor, country-or inventing a captivating cast of might-have-beens. He unifies his narrative with unusual but convincing historical theory: that Roma's vaunted religious tolerance, in turning the sacred into a mere instrument of governance, had sown the seeds of revolution-a spiritual and intellectual upheaval that here leads the children of Israel to a second and glorious trek to the stars. Guided by the sure hand of an old master, these many roads lead to a fascinating city of multitudinous souls.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jesus Loves the Little Children : Why We Baptize Children</h2><p>Jesus Loves the Little Children: Why We Baptize Children</p><p></p><h2>Conversations with the Goddesses: Revealing the Divine Power Within You</h2><p>Explores the ancient myths of the goddesses, revealing their personalities, to help women understand their own emotional patterns and to meet life&#39;s challenges</p><p>The Greek goddesses have inspired the female imagination for more then three thousand years.

This timeless classic was originally written to encourage a friend and stimulate his spiritual life. It was so appreciated that it was later published as a book for a wider readership. A hundred years later a copy was sent to George Whitefield by his friend, Charles Wesley - it was instrumental in Whitefield's conversion. This book provided much of the stimulation behind the Methodist Revival of Britain and the Great Awakening in America. In it Scougal explains the four essential characteristics of divine life, their excellence, their advantages and the practical steps that you can take in realising them as your personal experience.

Welcomed by Mexico as a buffer to U.S. settlement, Duwali&#x2019;s people had separated from other Western Cherokees in an effort to retain the tribe&#x2019;s traditional lifeways. As Dianne Everett details in The Texas Cherokees, they found themselves "caught between two fires" in many respects: between the Cherokee ideal of harmony and the reality of factionalism, between white settlers pushing westward and western Indians resisting incursions, and between traditional ways and the practical necessity of accommodating to whites.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dianna Everett</strong> holds the doctorate in history from Texas Tech University.</p></p><h2>Rousseau</h2><p><strong>The art of Henri Rousseau: A fascinating mixture of primitive idyll and flight from civilization</strong> &nbsp; Henri Rousseau (1844-1910) emerged from humble circumstances - reflected in his nickname, "the customs official." An employee in the Paris customs bureau, Rousseau was an autodidact who incrementally worked his way into a position among the artists who were renewing the art world at the turn of the century.<br> <br> It was a difficult journey - for years the art world laughed at the layman&#x2019;s flat, icon-like figures, simple landscapes and, in his late phase, exotic jungle scenes. But his "naive" compositions in fact became an emblem that piqued the interest of the avant-garde. Rousseau&#x2019;s jungle paintings consisted of ornamental variations of plant leaves, among which he set brilliantly colored predators, natives and naked beauties. In so doing, the artist evinced intuitive principles of design and compositions, which subsequent avant-garde artists had to work out for themselves with great effort.<br> <br> Ultimately winning recognition as an uncompromising modernist, Rousseau inspired comparison with Derain, C�zanne, Matisse and Gauguin. He became acquainted with Apollinaire, Delaunay, Picabia, Brancusi and other important figures; in 1908, Picasso held a legendary banquet in his honour. Today, "Rousseau&#x2019;s myth," a fascinating mixture of primitive idyll and flight from civilization, of concrete and abstract, holds a secure place in the history of art. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Contemporary Batik and Tie-Dye: Methods, Inspiration, Dyes (Crown&#39;s Arts and Crafts Series)</h2><p>Surveys the principles and procedures of working in batik and tie-dye and illustrates examples of art and fashion</p><p></p><h2>MG Midget Series &#34;TD&#34; Operation Manual</h2><p>All information needed to maintain the car in satisfactory condition.</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Malory: Death of a Dean (Mrs. Malory Mystery)</h2><p>When Mrs. Sheila Malory&#39;s trusted childhood friend, actor David Beaumont, calls upon her to clear his good name in the murder of his aunt and brother, the widowed fifty-something sleuth takes up the cause only to discover that the killer may be closer than she had realized. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Hazel Holt is the author of seven previous Mrs. Malory novels. She was a personal friend and literary advisor to Barbara Pym, and the author of Pym?s official biography. A former television critic and feature writer, she lives in Somerset, England.Once again, Sheila Malory, the village of Taviscombe's favorite widow (unable to say no to any request for a favor), is helping the inept, not to say inert, local police with their inquiries--this time in a murder case that hits close to home. Sheila had grown up with the victim--Francis Beaumont, Dean of Culminster Cathedral. His brother David, a once affluent, now hard- up actor, remains one of her closest friends. Francis, a tyrant to wife Joan, daughter Mary, and son Adrian, was poisoned by morphine, apparently while having tea (delivered by Joan) during an intense discussion with David on the subject of a valuable, jointly inherited property, now at last available for sale. The profits would salvage David's career, but Francis refused to sell, citing the low-ebb real-estate market. The church's congregation may mourn the loss of their handsome, charismatic leader, but Francis had also thwarted Mary's dream of partnering a riding stable and Adrian's hopes for independence and a loving family of his own. Even adoring, subservient wife Joan was sorely tried by her husband's well-hidden illicit affairs over the years. There are interesting questions being raised, too, by the Cathedral's treasurer. Sheila, probing these turbulent waters, makes her share of wrong guesses, but quickly zooms in on the rather clumsily manipulated final twist that provides the answer she seeks. The politely lethal mixture is, as before (Mrs.Malory Wonders Why, 1995, etc.), bland, literate, and engaging, but Sheila's seventh outing is strengthened this time by gutsier than usual plotlines. A delectable treat for cozy lovers, British style. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Yet this huge unrecorded &#34;hole&#34; in European history has been censored and stifled by political and literary authorities who have feared reprisals from angry Muslims trying to hide a legacy of brutality vastly more bloody and six times longer in duration than the atrocities of the crusades.This is the engrossing factual account of the immense and little-known Islamic military invasions of Europe, and the major players who led them, beginning around 650 CE. The Islamic Arabs (and later the Moors) occupied a number of the Mediterranean Islands, and invaded Spain and Portugal in 711 CE, and ruled over much of the Iberian peninsula for the next 800 years. France was attacked and invaded, as was Italy, and the European coasts all the way to Ireland and Iceland. The Muslims swept over the Balkans, besieged Vienna, and were intermittent masters of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary into the 19th century, destroying the Byzantines and conquering Constantinople (turning it into Istanbul). Ambitious and unrelenting, the Muslims also sought to conquer Austria and Russia.</p><p>Jihad is back, says Paul Fregosi, but this current incarnation has a long history behind it. From the start, Islamic fundamentalism has intended to expand the Muslim religion to encompass the entire world through conversion, or, in many instances, violence. Yet until now it has lacked a general historical narrative: "The jihad has been the most unrecorded and disregarded major event of history," writes Fregosi. <i>Jihad in the West</i> attempts to describe the history of Islamic and European conflict over 1,500 years, including moments such as the climactic battle at Tours (if the Moors had won it in 732, much of Europe might be Muslim today), the sieges of Vienna, and the Barbary Corsairs (the battle U.S. Marines refer to when they sing about "the shores of Tripoli"). Such a sweep necessarily sacrifices detail for breadth, yet it still provides a helpful backdrop to understanding a religious movement that has played a prominent role in late-20th-century terrorism. Many Muslims will quarrel with Fregosi when he compares jihad to a Christian sacrament, and the book would benefit from footnotes. <i>Jihad in the West</i> nevertheless is a good introduction to an often-ignored topic. <i>--John J.

Reprint. Tour.</p><p>"Like Doig's "This House of Sky," this book repeatedly proves the power of language. Ivan Doig uses words like oil paint to create canvasses of enduring value and originality."--"Los Angeles Times" <br>Ivan Doig grew up with only a vague memory of his mother, Berneta, who died on his sixth birthday.

Myers (co-author of the book "Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon") poured 15 years of research into this book. Legendary Grand Canyoneer Harvey Butchart climbed, hiked, floated and bushwhacked 12,000 pioneering miles below the rim during a 42-year obsession with the world-famous gorge. He became the first man to walk across Grand Canyon National Park, doing so in 1963 just ahead of writer Colin Fletcher, who famously described Butchart in his classic adventure book "The Man Who Walked Through Time." </p><p>Here for the first time is Harvey's life story: his early years as a fatherless child in a mystical, rugged mountain range in China, his struggles in America during the Great Depression, and finally, his all-consuming drive for greatness by exploring one of the West's last unknown wildernesses. Butchart's accomplishments found favor with the public, but also led to the death of his favorite hiking partner and took a decades-long toll on his marriage.</p><p> The authors retrace Harvey's footsteps on dangerous cliff edges while chronicling his thrilling exploits, heart-breaking tragedies, and lasting triumphs. Part biography, part modern-day adventure, "Grand Obsession" will take you deeper into the soul of this fascinating man - and Grand Canyon - than you have ever been before.</p><p> Contains over 170 photographs, many never-before-published, and Harvey Butchart's hand-stenciled maps showing his treks in Grand Canyon. The paperback edition contains black-and-white maps, the hardback edition contains color maps.</p><p>Butchart's feats continue to receive recognition, most recently by the Arizona State Board of Names, which in 2008 designated a rocky summit "Butchart Butte" within Grand Canyon National Park.</p></p><p>Elias Butler is a writer and photographer living in Flagstaff, Arizona. Butler has written for <i>Backpacker, National Geographic Adventure, The Fretboard Journal, the Las Vegas-Review Journal and the Arizona Daily Sun</i>. Butler's photography has been published in <i> USA Today, Reader's Digest, Arizona Highways, and Backpacker</i> . This is his first book. <p>At age 19, Tom Myers began celebrating the dawning of each new year by hiking in the Grand Canyon. It is a tradition he and his wife continue to share with their three children. He has co-authored two previous Canyon books, <i> Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon </i> (with Michael Ghiglieri) and <i> Fateful Journey </i> (with Larry Stevens and Chris Becker).</p>"Butler and Myers do wonders with this book, taking what seems at first glance a prosaic subject, and fashioning it into a fascinating portrait of a man hopelessly addicted to a place." -- 2008 National Outdoor Book Awards, which named <i>Grand Obsession </i> a winner in the History/Biography category.<p>"Of all the Grand Canyon books out there, this one stands alone as a classic work showcasing man and nature at their best." -- Lynn Arave, <i> The Deseret Morning News</i></p><p> "Through Butchart's experiences, readers get a feel for how impressive, humbling, unforgiving and fascinating this place is. Read it." -- Amy Maesta, <i> Inside/Outside Southwest</i></p><p>"There's a special word for finding your own way around the Grand Canyon without following established trails: "butcharting," an homage to Harvey Butchart." -- Susan Spano, <i> The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Written by two other Canyon explorers, with personal accounts of their efforts to follow in Butchart's footsteps, this story of a remarkable life transcends biography and becomes gripping adventure." -- Pima County Library and Arizona Historical Society, which named "Grand Obsession" a 2007 Southwest Book of the Year. </p><p>"The book is well written and the story of Harvey's life is extremely interesting. I highly recommend this book!" -- Denise Traver, former NPS ranger and author of hitthetrail, a Grand Canyon website. </p><p>"Harvey Butchart, the man who has walked over more of the Grand Canyon than any other alive or dead..." --Edward Abbey, writing in his journal at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in 1969 --Ed Abbey<br><br>"Nobody knew the Grand Canyon better than Harvey Butchart did. Now comes our chance to better know Butchart, the enigmatic hiker-explorer who is regarded as the father of American desert canyoneering. "Grand Obsession: Harvey Butchart and the Exploration of Grand Canyon," by Elias Butler and Tom Myers, tells the story of this mild-mannered math professor who turned tenacious below the canyon's rims - logging 12,000 miles on foot, blazing dozens of new routes from rim to river and notching 28 first recorded ascents of buttes and other formidable formations in the canyon's torrid interior. He wrote three famously cryptic backcountry guidebooks that helped cement his status among canyon aficionados as part Superman, part Yoda." --Joe Hudson, The Denver Post<br><br>"Harvey Butchart was the legendary hiker and canyoneer who explored more of the Grand Canyon than any other person. He was largely known through his sparse and somewhat cryptic hiking guidebooks. But even more cryptic was Butchart himself. Who was this man, and why did his interest in the canyon become an obsession that consumed his life? You'll find out in this uncommonly well researched, well-structured and well-written biography." --2008 2008 National Outdoor Book Awards web site</p></p><h2>Trieste</h2><p>Jan Morris has crafted a meditation on a most unusual city. James (as she was then) first visited Trieste as a soldier at the end of World War II. Since then, the city has come to represent her own life, with all its hopes, disillusionments, loves and memories.</p><p>Jan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea. Her books include Coronation Everest, Venice, The Pax Britannica Trilogy (Heaven&#39;s Command, Pax Britannica, and Farewell the Trumpets), and Conundrum. She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and, more recently, the unclassifiable Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere. A Writer&#39;s World, a collection of her travel writing and reportage from over five decades, was published in 2003. Hav, her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Her most recent book, Contact!, about the people she encountered on her many travels, was published in 2009.&#39;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a writer alive who has Jan Morris&#39;s serenity or strength.&#39; Paul Theroux</p><h2>The Works of John Newton (4 Volume Set)</h2><p>When John Newton, ex-sea captain and, as yet, unsuccessful candidate for the Church of England ministry, finished his first book (an autobiography) in 1762 there was no ready publisher. Any thought that he was destined to become one of the best known authors of his age would have been as fantastic as the last 37 years of his life. But in both cases the improbable came about. Becoming curate of Olney, a small village in the south of England, in 1764, Newton there laid his reputation as an evangelical writer, pre-eminently by his published letters and by the Olney Hymns (including 'How Great the Name of Jesus Sounds', 'Glorious things of Thee are spoken' and 'Amazing grace'). Before the end of his subsequent pastorate at St. Mary Woolnoth, London (1780-1807), his writings were prized around the world from America to Australia.<br><br>Newton has a firm place in the classics of Christian literature. While his style is strong and clear, it is the spiritual attractiveness and importance of his main themes which secure the permanent value of his writings. Most of his books came, unpremeditated, out of a need to help his congregation or individual hearers, and it is in practical helpfulness towards Christian living that he excels. If he is loved rather than admired, it is for this reason. Conformity to Christ is the one subject upon which his themes finally focus ('It will not be a burden to me at the hour of death that I have thought too highly of Jesus, expected too much from Him myself, or laboured too much in commending and setting Him forth to others'). Not surprisingly, Alexander Whyte could write, 'For myself, I keep John Newton on my selectest shelf of spiritual books: by far the best kind of books in the whole world of books.'<br><br>The text of this new four-volume edition of <i>The Works of John Newton</i> has been entirely reformatted, producing a clear and easily navigable set of documents for today's reader.</p><p>Born in London in 1725, deprived of the godly influence of his mother before he was seven years old, John Newton was but two years at school before he went, at the age of eleven, on his first voyage with his father, a sea captain. From that time till the age of thirty, when his health was broken by a stroke, Newton endured the wild rigours of a life before the mast, including being press-ganged aboard a naval vessel and flogged when captured after desertion. Only his love for the youthful Mary Catlett preserved him from suicide. He was released from the navy only to join in the slave traffic across the Atlantic, and was reduced almost to death on the Guinea coast before being delivered by a friend of his father's.<br><br>Throughout these sad events there ran a divine purpose; and while Newton forgot the Saviour whom his mother had so often commended to him in childhood, and while he became, like one of old, a 'blasphemer and injurious,' it was all leading to a day in the midst of a tremendous storm at sea when he was brought to say: 'I stood in need of an Almighty Saviour, and such a one I found described in the New Testament. The Lord had wrought a marvellous thing.''In few writers are Christian doctrine, experience and practice more happily balanced than in the author of these letters, and few write with more simplicity, piety and force.' --<i>Charles H. Spurgeon</i><br><br>'What thousands have derived repeated profit and pleasure from the perusal of these utterances of the heart! Nor ever will they cease to be found means of grace whilst God has a church on earth.' --<i>William Jay</i><br><br>'It was Newton's <i>goodness</i> rather than his <i>greatness</i> that rendered him so especially attractive the abundance of the grace of God that was in him. In this respect he was preeminent, justifying the eulogy of William Jay who speaks of him as one of the most perfect instances of the spirit and temper of Christianity he ever knew. Some men excel in one virtue more than another. But Newton's character was beautiful in its entireness. It rested on a solid foundation the initial Christian grace of humility, and of this grace he was a most striking example. He never for a moment forgot that by the grace of God he was what he was.' --<i>Josiah Bull</i></p><h2>The English gypsy caravan: its origins, builders, technology and conservation,</h2><p>, 215 pages, with black and white photographic plates and line drawings</p><p></p><h2>Back to Basics: Rediscovering the Richness of the Reformed Faith</h2><p>The Reformed faith is a rich tapestry of biblical understanding that encompasses all of thought and life.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Instead, he became a poet. His life on a farm in New Hampshire inspired him to write "poetry that talked," and today he is famous for his vivid descriptions of the rural life he loved so much. There was a time, though, when Frost had to struggle to get his poetry published. Told from the point of view of Lesley, Robert Frost's oldest daughter, this is the story of how a lover of language found his voice.</p></p><p><p>Natalie S. Bober is an award-winning biographer and historian who has written about Thomas Jefferson, Abigail Adams, and William Wordsworth, among others. She is the author of the middle-grade book <i>A Restless Spirit: The Story of Robert Frost</i>. She lives in Port Washington, New York.</p><p>Rebecca Gibbon is the illustrator of many picture books, including <i>Elizabeth Leads the Way</i>, an ALA Notable Book; and <i>Celebritrees. </i>She lives in England with her family.</p>Gr 3-5&#x2013;Bober's picture-book biography is narrated by Frost's oldest daughter, Lesley, and based upon her childhood journal. It begins with the family's return home from two years in England, where they had lived so Frost could concentrate on writing poetry instead of farming. &#x201c;Papa had the courage to trust his own feelings and know what he had to do. He made a reckless choice,&#x201d; says the teen, quoting the first verse of &#x201c;The Road Not&nbsp;Taken.&#x201d;&nbsp; As she waits with her mother and siblings in New York's Grand Central Terminal for the train to New Hampshire, her father visits the publisher of a book of his&nbsp;poetry that his wife saw reviewed in&nbsp;the New Republic. Lesley recalls her childhood at Derry Farm, where her papa raised chickens and sold their eggs; took his family on all-day Sunday picnics; and, with his wife, homeschooled the children. Reading and memorizing poetry were highly stressed in the Frost household, as was the purchase of books. (&#x201c;Papa thought that any book worth reading twice was worth owning.&#x201d;) Bober has captured the poet's personality, his love for family, and the inner strength that allowed him to follow his dreams. Indeed, he returns to the station with a contract for two books&#x2013;the beginning of his successful writing career. An author's note offers further biographical information. Photos, quotations, a short bibliography, and a dozen of Frost's poems are appended. Charming, detailed folk-art-style watercolor paintings add to the appeal of this readable introduction to a great American poet.&#x2013;Susan Scheps, formerly at Shaker Public Library, OH&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

It&#39;s the same great content, now with a new title and cover. Thinksheets for Tweens and Teens focuses on the social issues and challenges faced by pre-adolescents and adolescents and introduces social concepts and strategies that can help individuals navigate these tricky years. Social rules and expectations change with age; thinking and behavior that was appropriate in elementary school can quickly become inappropriate and unexpected as students move into middle and high school. We developed these Thinksheets to help educators, therapists, and parents encourage more mature social thinking and related shifts in their students&#39; social skills. The Thinksheets explore a wide range of topics, starting with the basic Social Thinking understanding of the Four Steps of Communication, to exploring the hidden rules of the classroom and when is it okay to correct others. Chapters include What Is Social Communication?, Problem Solving, Lessons on Emotions, Different Perspectives, Being Bossy and Jerky, Lessons on Friendships, The Social Fake and Other Tricks, and Participating in Groups. There are more than 160 Thinksheets across these 8 sections, and all are included on the Mac/PC friendly CD that comes with the book.

Happy at Last</h2><p>&#34;Not even Hollywood in its heyday could have dreamed up a melodrama so electrifying as the one that swirled around 10-year-old &#34;Little Gloria&#34; Vanderbilt in 1934 when she became the object of a scandalous custody battle between her beautiful but poor, and none too bright, mother, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and her rich, powerful aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney whose own private life included several lovers and a pseudonymous novel about lesbianism. Taking the court case as her focal point, and documenting it every step of the way, Goldsmith has produced a book of fabulous readability. It is the psychological perception she brings to her story that grips so intensely, however. What she is chronicling is the whole passing parade of American and international high society at a time of tumultuous transition when the old guard was giving way to the new &#34;caf�&#34; society. And what a cast of characters she has?everything from royals (Thelma, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt&#39;s twin, was mistress to the Prince of Wales), grande dames, a rigid Irish Catholic Tammany judge, and a &#34;devoted,&#34; hideously possessive nurse, to the terrified little girl, told her mother might kill her. Over it all loomed the aura of the Lindbergh kidnapping. Goldsmith probes the motives, the secrets, the hidden longings of them all credibly and compassionately in a book that will sell and sell and sell.

Pollitzer and O'Keeffe met in 1914 in an art class, and it was Pollitzer who introduced O'Keeffe's drawings to photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz, thus sparking a legendary and dynamic collaboration. In her charming look at O'Keeffe's girlhood on a Wisconsin farm and in Williamsburg, Va., Pollitzer draws on the memories of neighbors and friends to create a portrait of a young woman who was independent, quietly confident, hardworking and brave. From O'Keeffe's first exhibit at Stieglitz's gallery in 1916 to the 1950s, when the memoir ends, Pollitzer focuses primarily on O'Keeffe's arther smaller nature studies, her signature giant flowers and the work inspired by her beloved New Mexico desert. The reader might wish Pollitzer would have delved into the personal morethe relationship between O'Keeffe and Stieglitz calls out for greater comment. But instead, the author gathers discerning, eye-opening statements on O'Keeffe's art from critics, artists like Stieglitz and Charles Demuth, and from O'Keeffe herself, whose correspondence, comments and exhibit introductions eloquently and movingly express the awesome love of life and the natural world that inspired her art. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Having met as art students in New York, Pollitzer and Georgia O'Keeffe carried on a lively correspondence over many decades. It was Pollitzer who first showed O'Keeffe's drawings to Alfred Stieglitz. Pollitzer has written not a biography but a memoir full of family stories, artistic anecdotes, and fierce affection for her friend. The excerpts from the early letters are most wonderful, for these young women asked all the eternal questions about art and life, and one of them answered in a wholly new way. Here, the rigor and passion of O'Keeffe's painting are given not only lucid analysis, but also the framework of a life. Essential for art and women's history collections; highly recommended for general collections. GraceAnne A.

But, over the past ten years, neoconservatism has become a force in criminology. Wilson, the leading advocate of this right-ward move, and Herrnstein, who is noted for his work on I.Q., race, and meritocracy, have written what should become the major source on this important development in criminology. Its moderate, Aristotelian behavioral theory is reminiscent of Edward Banfield's Unheavenly City Revisited and Ernest Van Den Haag's Punishing Criminals , but this book probably will have greater impact than either of these or any of Wilson's and Herrnstein's earlier writings. It will be praised by many and criticized by others who will complain that it does not expose the proper ``myths about crime,'' does not explain why ``the rich get richer and the poor get prison,'' and turns attention away from the corrupting influence of modern institutions. Essential reading for anyone seriously interested in crime or human nature. John Broderick, Sociology Department, Stone hill College, N.

But an uninvited guest - in the form of a mummified, armless and legless torso - has crashed the party. There's no telling how long the dead body has been in the cellar, or even who it once was.<br>Intrigued with the new mystery on her hands, Jude elicits Carole's help to solve the case - and hopefully snap Carole out of her growing depression from a recent failed relationship. Their detective work soon uncovers that Pelling House's previous owners include two divorced couples who harbor a lot of resentment. And Jude and Carole suspect that they may be harboring some dark secrets as well.</p><p><b>Simon Brett</b>, called by <b>The Baltimore Sun</b> "one of the wittiest mystery writers around", is the author of the Mrs. Pargeter Mystery series, and the creator of the Charles Paris mysteries. <b>Death on the Downs</b> is the second novel in the new Fethering Mystery series, following <b>The Body on the Beach</b>. A former president of Britain&#x2019;s Crime Writers&#x2019; Association and Chair of the Society of Authors, he lives in the south of England with his family.(*Starred Review*) A dinner party in a richly restored country house in a Sussex village that is "riddled with class consciousness" is interrupted by a scream. A body, arms and legs neatly removed, has been discovered in the cellar. There to witness the discovery is an outsider, a middle-aged woman from the seaside village of Fethering. The woman, Jude, brings news of the grisly find back to her pal Carole, another middle-aged woman from Fethering, in hopes that a little mystery will pull her out of a depression brought on by a lapsed love affair. The two friends, one an ebullient New Age healer sort, the other a prickly, introverted retiree from the Home Office, are Brett's newest series sleuths, following in the footsteps of the author's two long-running series stars, Mrs. Pargeter and Charles Paris. As in their debut, the acclaimed <i>Body on the Beach</i> (2000), the ladies from Fethering once again proceed totally outside the bumbling police investigation in a somehow utterly credible way, gaining access and insight where the police can't. An "art crawl" through the village, for example, gives Jude and Carole clues cops would miss. Brett provides plenty of jolts along the way as the sins of the village writhe to the surface. A traditional country-house mystery, broadened and spiced by splendidly evocative writing and canny social comedy. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As the bats went to roost, a million fires would flare up in remote crannies of the wood and paper buildings common throughout Japan. When their cities were reduced to ashes, the Japanese would surely capitulate...</p> <p>The plan made sense to a handful of eccentric promoters and researchers, who convinced top military brass and even President Roosevelt to back the scheme. It might have worked, except that another secret weapon&#x2014;something to do with atoms&#x2014;was chosen to end the war.</p> <p>Told here by the youngest member of the team, this is the story of the bat bomb project, or Project X-Ray, as it was officially known. In scenes worthy of a Capra or Hawks comedy, Jack Couffer recounts the unorthodox experiments carried out in the secrecy of Bandera, Texas; Carlsbad, New Mexico; and El Centro, California, in 1942-1943 by "Doc" Adams' private army. This oddball cast of characters included an eccentric inventor, a distinguished Harvard scientist, a biologist with a chip on his shoulder, a movie star, a Texas guano collector, a crusty Marine Corps colonel, a Maine lobster fisherman, an ex-mobster, and a tiger.</p> <p>Not to be defeated by minor logistical hurdles, the bat bomb researchers risked life and limb to explore uncharted bat caves and "recruit" thousands of bats to serve their country. Through months of personality conflicts, military snafus, and technical failures the team pressed on, certain that bats could end the war with Japan. And they might have&#x2014;in their first airborne test, the bat bombers burned an entire brand-new military airfield to the ground.</p> <p>For everyone who relishes true tales of action and adventure, Bat Bomb is a must-read. Bat enthusiasts will also discover the beginnings of the scientific study of bats.</p></p><p>Since World War II Jack Couffer has pursued a career in film as a director,writer, producer, and cameraman. His work has appeared in numerous popular films, including Out of Africa, Ring of Bright Water, and Never Cry Wolf.One of World War II's more improbable projects was the plan to release myriads of bats bearing incendiary devices over Japan's cities. The concept worked all too well, but the whole thing came to an end shortly after the nocturnal raiders immolated a remote New Mexico air base. Couffer's account is smoothly written but not glib, and the natural humor is buttressed with official documents saved from his months on the project. More than just a funny wartime memoir, this book illustrates how the wartime military establishment handled an offbeat idea that just might have been useful. Best of all, it provides marvelous insights into the social ethos that prevailed during the wartime years. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Raymond L.

Vestiges of their art, architecture, and unique language have long intrigued scholars, and the search for this mysterious civilization continues to fire the imagination. Despite a history of pillage, rich archaeological evidence survives: thousands of tombs, many of them frescoed and filled with vases, sculpture, jewelry, and metalwork; and the mysterious Etruscan sites that are places of tourist pilgrimage, such as Cerveteri, Vulci, and Tarquinia. In this new book, the first survey of its kind in more than twenty years, Nigel Spivey brings the Etruscan world to life, illuminating the social, political, and cultural context of the art objects and artifacts that remain the singular achievement of the Etruscans. 186 illustrations, 37 in color</p><p>Nigel Jonathan Spivey is Lecturer in Classics at the University of Cambridge.

Authorized DVD Copies intended for educational purposes only. DESCRIPTION: We live in a world which is increasingly dominated by revolutionary new technology but, according to author and lecturer, David Icke, it is WE who are the robots. In this DVD, Icke reveals the alarming extent to which people of all nations have allowed themselves to be programmed by the ideas fed to them by those in power. Fearlessly, he tears down the veils of hypocrisy, built up for generations by the corrupt forces of Church, State, science and commerce - and reveals the true pathos of the human condition beneath. He points, too, to the frightening influence wielded throughout the planet by a merciless and manipulative network of secret societies. The existence of long-established links between Earth-bound humanity and beings from other dimensions and planets in the Universe has been suppressed for years, says Icke, by the world&#39;s power-broking hierarchy. When ordinary people learn the real role they have to play within a rich and varied cosmic society, rebellion against those who have kept this extraordinary truth from them will, he predicts, be inevitable. Hidebound politicians, bankers, economists, educationalists, scientists and the leaders of the world&#39;s established religions are not going to welcome Icke&#39;s &#34;Robots&#39; Rebellion&#34;. But it is not intended for those who wield and abuse power. This DVD is for the world&#39;s unwilling robots who, says Icke, in an upbeat conclusion, have it within themselves to rise up - and take control of their own exciting destiny.</p><p>The author is no stranger to controversy.

It includes groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, MIT railroad club and more; the shapers of the digital revolution.</p><p>Steven Levy&#39;s classic book explains why the misuse of the word &#34;hackers&#34; to describe computer criminals does a terrible disservice to many important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy follows members of an MIT model railroad club--a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and computer innovators--from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term &#34;hack&#34; to describe a clever way of improving the electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing clever ways to improve computer systems, &#34;hack&#34; moved over with them. These maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as &#34;The Hacker Ethic.&#34; The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide audience.<p>Levy is a senior writer for Wired.

This meditation ranges from the problematic effects of a defect in language to actual historical experiments in community. The latter involves the life and work of George Bataille whose concerns (e.g. &#x201c;the negative community&#x201d;) occupy the foreground of Blanchot&#x2019;s discussion. Taking as his point of departure an essay by French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, Blanchot appears once again as one of the most attentive readers of what is truly challenging in French thought. His deep interest in the fiction of Marguerite Duras extends this inquiry to include &#x201c;The Community of Lovers,&#x201d; emerging from certain themes in Duras&#x2019; recit, The Malady of Death. As Blanchot&#x2019;s first direct treatment of a subject that has long figured in or behind his work, this small but highly concentrated book stands as an important addition to his own contribution to literary, philosophical, social, and political thought, figuring as it does at the center of the emerging concern for a redefinition of politics and community. Readers of Blanchot know not to expect answers to the great questions that move his thought - rather, to live with the questions at the new level to which they have been raised in his discourse</p><p>Maurice Blanchot is one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in modern French writing.

Only a few facts are known about Mary's young female jester, le Jardiniere, but Yolen and her collaborator, Scottish writer Robert Harris, have created a fascinating girl narrator based on this historical oddity. Le Jardiniere relates the true and tragic tale of the ill-fated 16th-century queen of Scotland.<p> In 1559, when a ragtag troupe of traveling entertainers is snatched from the sodden streets of Rheims to amuse the bored visiting French court, 13-year-old Nicola Ambruzzi impresses the queen with her wit and honesty. The beautiful young Mary takes the girl under her protection as "the queen's own fool," commissioned to speak the truth boldly amid the fawning lies and schemes of the courtiers. Around them swarm secret plots, duplicity, and betrayal; death is a constant threat. </p><p> After her weak boy-husband King Francis dies, the kindhearted Mary is unwilling to hear Nicola speak the truth about her suitors. She experiences two disastrous marriages, first with the handsome wastrel Darnley and then--for political expediency--with his murderer, the treacherous Bothwell. When he plots against her, she must flee back to Scotland to try to resume her throne in the midst of swirling conflict between the Protestant lords and their Catholic rulers. Nicola's wit and daring get them through some dangerous situations, but Mary is eventually imprisoned in the stark castle of Lochleven, where their hairsbreadth attempts at escape wind up a story from history as exciting and deeply affecting as any of Yolen's fantasy novels.

I know of no more useful volume on the topic. Despite the postmodern connotations of the title, Von Hendy is writing not to expose the concept of myth but simply to show the array of ways in which it has been used from time to time and from place to place. A superb work." &#x2015;Robert A. Segal, <br>University of Lancaster, <br>author of <i>Theorizing about Myth</i></p><p>Andrew Von Hendy offers an integrated critical account of the career of myth in modernity. He takes as its starting point some crucial moments in the 18th-century reinvention of the concept and then follows the major branches of theorizing as they appear in the work of theologians, philosophers, literary artists, political thinkers, folklorists, anthropologists, psychologists, and others.</p><p>Von Hendy pursues each of these four fundamental strains of theory through the 20th century: the rise of neo-romantic theories in depth psychology, modernist literature, and later in religious phenomenology, philosophy, and literary criticism; the establishment of folkloristic theory in ethnological fieldwork and in classical studies; the growth of ideological theories from Sorel to Barthes and Derrida; and the recent ascent of constitutive theories of myth as necessary fiction. Finally, Von Hendy examines the work of five theorists who attempt to come to terms with the lessons of the ideological critique, yet regard myth as a constructive phenomenon.<br> </p></p><p><p>Andrew Von Hendy is Associate Professor of English at Boston College and author of articles on late medieval, early modern and nineteenth-century English poetry, drama, and fiction; on Northrop Frye's mythography; and on conceptions of myth among modernist poets and novelists of the early twentieth century</p><p>Von Hendy (English, Boston College) begins his study with the 18th&#x2015;century re&#x2015;creation of the concept of myth and traces its development through three subsequent classes of theories, all deriving from the romantic or transcendental theory: the ideological, the folkloric, and the constitutive, each of which persists today. The book's organization is basically chronological, but, because of the complex interdisciplinarity of writings on myth, it is also partly taxonomic and partly evaluative. Whereas other mythographers tend to concentrate on the mature theories of the writers, Von Hendy explores the development of the theories and the influences on them. His grasp of the subject is masterful; his elucidation of the genealogy of the theories and his evaluation of them are exceptional in their comprehensiveness. His style, however, is unusually dense and laborious. Although there is some overlap with William Doty's Mythography: The Study of Myths and Rituals, (1986; 2nd ed., 2000), Jan de Vries' Forschungsgeschichte der Mythologie (1961), and The Rise of Modern Mythology 1680&#x2015;1860, compiled by Burton Feldman and Robert Richardson (CH, Oct'72), Von Hendy's work is sui generis.

It&#x2019;s a simple thing, sitting at a table and eating a meal with those you love, and many people do it every day without giving it much thought. For me, it&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve been dreaming of for almost a year. I contemplated what it would be like to eat this meal so many times, now that I&#x2019;m finally here, it doesn&#x2019;t seem entirely real. The faces of the people I love that I haven&#x2019;t seen for so long, the chatter of many people talking together, the clink of silverware, the swish of wine in a glass&#x2014;these are all unfamiliar. Even the sensation of gravity holding me in my chair feels strange, and every time I put a glass or fork down on the table there&#x2019;s a part of my mind that is looking for a dot of Velcro or a strip of duct tape to hold it in place. I&#x2019;ve been back on Earth for forty-eight hours.&nbsp;<br><br>I push back from the table and struggle to stand up, feeling like an old man getting out of a recliner.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Stick a fork in me, I&#x2019;m done,&#x201d; I announce. Everyone laughs and encourages me to go and get some rest. I start the journey to my bedroom: about twenty steps from the chair to the bed. On the third step, the floor seems to lurch under me, and I stumble into a planter. Of course it wasn&#x2019;t the floor&#x2014;it was my vestibular system trying to readjust to Earth&#x2019;s gravity. I&#x2019;m getting used to walking again.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first time I&#x2019;ve seen you stumble,&#x201d; Mark says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing pretty good.&#x201d; He knows from personal experience what it&#x2019;s like to come back to gravity after having been in space. As I walk by Samantha, I put my hand on her shoulder and she smiles up at me.&nbsp;<br><br>I make it to my bedroom without incident and close the door behind me. Every part of my body hurts. All of my joints and all of my muscles are protesting the crushing pressure of gravity. I&#x2019;m also nauseated, though I haven&#x2019;t thrown up. I strip off my clothes and get into bed, relishing the feeling of sheets, the light pressure of the blanket over me, the fluff of the pillow under my head. All of these are things I missed dearly. I can hear the happy murmur of my family behind the door, voices I haven&#x2019;t heard without the distortion of phones bouncing signals off satellites for a year. I drift off to sleep to the comforting sound of their talking and laughing.&nbsp;<br><br>A crack of light wakes me: Is it morning? No, it&#x2019;s just Amiko coming to bed. I&#x2019;ve only been asleep for a couple of hours. But I feel delirious. It&#x2019;s a struggle to come to consciousness enough to move, to tell her how awful I feel. I&#x2019;m seriously nauseated now, feverish, and my pain has gotten worse. This isn&#x2019;t like how I felt after my last mission. This is much, much worse.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Amiko,&#x201d; I finally manage to say. <br><br>She is alarmed by the sound of my voice. <br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Her hand is on my arm, then on my forehead. Her skin feels chilled, but it&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m so hot. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel good,&#x201d; I say. <br><br>I&#x2019;ve been to space four times now, and she has gone through the whole process with me as my main support once before, when I spent 159 days on the space station in 2010&#x2013;11. I had a reaction to coming back from space that time, but it was nothing like this.&nbsp;<br><br>I struggle to get up. Find the edge of the bed. Feet down. Sit up. Stand up. At every stage I feel like I&#x2019;m fighting through quicksand. When I&#x2019;m finally vertical, the pain in my legs is awful, and on top of that pain I feel something even more alarming: all the blood in my body is rushing to my legs, like the sensation of the blood rushing to your head when you do a headstand, but in reverse. I can feel the tissue in my legs swelling. I shuffle my way to the bathroom, moving my weight from one foot to the other with deliberate effort. Left. Right. Left. Right.&nbsp;<br><br>I make it to the bathroom, flip on the light, and look down at my legs. They are swollen and alien stumps, not legs at all.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Amiko, come look at this.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She kneels down and squeezes one ankle, and it squishes like a water balloon. She looks up at me with worried eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even feel your anklebones,&#x201d; she says.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;My skin is burning, too,&#x201d; I tell her. Amiko frantically examines me. I have a strange rash all over my back, the backs of my legs, the back of my head and neck&#x2014;everywhere I was in contact with the bed. I can feel her cool hands moving over my inflamed skin. &#x201c;It looks like an allergic rash,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Like hives.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>I use the bathroom and shuffle back to bed, wondering what I should do. Normally if I woke up feeling like this, I would go to the emergency room, but no one at the hospital will have seen symptoms of having been in space for a year. I crawl back into bed, trying to find a way to lie down without touching my rash. I can hear Amiko rummaging in the medicine cabinet. She comes back with two ibuprofen and a glass of water. As she settles down, I can tell from her every movement, every breath, that she is worried about me. We both knew the risks of the mission I signed on for. After six years together, I can understand her perfectly even in the wordless dark.&nbsp;<br><br>As I try to will myself to sleep, I wonder whether my friend Mikhail Kornienko is also suffering from swollen legs and painful rashes&#x2014; Misha is home in Moscow after spending nearly a year in space with me. I suspect so. This is why we volunteered for this mission, after all: to discover how the human body is affected by long-term space flight. Scientists will study the data on Misha and me for the rest of our lives and beyond. Our space agencies won&#x2019;t be able to push out farther into space, to a destination like Mars, until we can learn more about how to strengthen the weakest links in the chain that makes space flight possible: the human body and mind. People often ask me why I volunteered for this mission, knowing the risks&#x2014;the risk of launch, the risk inherent in spacewalks, the risk of returning to Earth, the risk I would be exposed to every moment I lived in a metal container orbiting the Earth at 17,500 miles per hour. I have a few answers I give to this question, but none of them feels fully satisfying to me. None of them quite answers it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a boy, I had a strange recurring daydream. I saw myself confined to a small space, barely big enough to lie down in. Curled up on the floor, I knew that I would be there for a long time. I couldn&#x2019;t leave, but I didn&#x2019;t mind&#x2014;I had the feeling I had everything I needed. Something about that small space, the sense that I was doing something challenging just by living there, was appealing to me. I felt I was where I belonged.&nbsp;<br><br>One night when I was five, my parents shook Mark and me awake and hustled us down to the living room to watch a blurry gray image on TV, which they explained was men walking on the moon. I remember hearing the staticky voice of Neil Armstrong and trying to make sense of the outrageous claim that he was visiting the glowing disc in the New Jersey summer sky I could see out our window. Watching the moon landing left me with a strange recurring nightmare: I dreamed I was preparing to launch on a rocket to the moon, but rather than being secured safely in a seat inside, I was instead strapped across the pointy end of the rocket, my back against its nose cone, facing straight up at the heavens. The moon loomed over me, its giant craters threatening, as I waited through the countdown. I knew I couldn&#x2019;t possibly survive the moment of ignition. Every time I had this dream, I woke up, sweating and terrified, just before the engines burned their fire into the sky.&nbsp;<br><br>As a kid, I took all the risks I could, not because I was foolhardy but because everything else was boring. I threw myself off things, crawled under things, took dares from other boys, skated and slid and swam and capsized, sometimes tempting death. Mark and I climbed up drainpipes starting when we were six, waving back down at our parents from roofs two or three stories up. Attempting something difficult was the only way to live. If you were doing something safe, something you already knew could be done, you were wasting time. I found it bewildering that some people my age could just sit still, breathing and blinking, for entire school days&#x2014;that they could resist the urge to run outside, to take off exploring, to do something new, to take risks. What went through their heads? What could they learn in a classroom that could even approach the feeling of flying down a hill out of control on a bike?&nbsp;<br><br>I was a terrible student, always staring out windows or looking at the clock, waiting for class to be over. My teachers scolded, then chastised, then finally&#x2014;some of them&#x2014;ignored me. My parents, a cop and a secretary, tried unsuccessfully to discipline my brother and me. Neither of us listened. We were on our own much of the time&#x2014;after school, while our parents were still at work, and on weekend mornings, when our parents were sleeping off a hangover. We were free to do what we liked, and what we liked was to take risks.&nbsp;<br><br>During my high school years, for the first time I found something I was good at that adults approved of: I worked as an emergency medical technician. When I took the EMT classes, I discovered that I had the patience to sit down and study. I started as a volunteer and in a few years worked my way up to a full-time job. I rode in an ambulance all night, never knowing what I would face next&#x2014;gunshot wounds, heart attacks, broken bones. Once I delivered a baby in a public housing project, the mother in a rancid bed with old unwashed sheets, a single naked lightbulb swinging overhead, dirty dishes piled in the sink. The heart-pounding feeling of walking into a potentially dangerous situation and having to depend on my wits was intoxicating. I was dealing with life-and-death situations, not boring&#x2014;and, to me, pointless&#x2014; classroom subjects. In the morning, I often drove home and went to sleep instead of going to school.&nbsp;<br><br>I managed to graduate from high school, in the bottom half of my class. I went to the only college I was accepted to (which was a different college than the one I had meant to apply to&#x2014;such were my powers of concentration). There, I had no more interest in schoolwork than I&#x2019;d had in high school, and I was also getting too old to jump off things for fun. Partying took the place of physical risk, but it wasn&#x2019;t as satisfying. When asked by adults, I said I wanted to be a doctor. I&#x2019;d signed up for premed classes but was failing them in my first semester. I knew I was just marking time until I&#x2019;d be told I would have to do something else, and I had no idea what that would be.&nbsp;<br><br>One day I walked into the campus bookstore to buy snacks, and a display caught my eye. The letters on the book&#x2019;s cover seemed to streak into the future with unstoppable speed:&nbsp;<i>The Right Stuff.&nbsp;</i>I wasn&#x2019;t much of a reader&#x2014;whenever I was assigned to read a book for school, I would barely flip through it, hopelessly bored. Sometimes I&#x2019;d look at the CliffsNotes and remember enough of what I read to pass a test on the book, sometimes not. I had not read many books by choice in my entire life&#x2014;but this book somehow drew me to it.&nbsp;<br><br>I picked up a copy, and its first sentences dropped me into the stench of a smoky field at the naval air station in Jacksonville, Florida, where a young test pilot had just been killed and burned beyond recognition. He had crashed his airplane into a tree, which &#x201c;knocked [his] head to pieces like a melon.&#x201d; The scene captured my attention like nothing else I had ever read. Something about this was deeply familiar, though I couldn&#x2019;t say what.&nbsp;<br><br>I bought the book and lay on my unmade dorm room bed reading it for the rest of the day, heart pounding, Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s hyperactive, looping sentences ringing in my head. I was captivated by the description of the Navy test pilots, young hotshots catapulting off aircraft carriers, testing unstable airplanes, drinking hard, and generally moving through the world like exceptional badasses.&nbsp;<br><br><i>The idea here (in the all-enclosing fraternity) seemed to be that a man should have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment&#x2014;and then to go up again the next day, and the next day, and every next day, even if the series should prove infinite&#x2014;and, ultimately, in its best expression, do so in a cause that means something to thousands, to a people, a nation, to humanity, to God.&nbsp;</i><br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t just an exciting adventure story. This was something more like a life plan. These young men, flying jets in the Navy, did a real job that existed in the real world. Some of them became astronauts, and that was a real job too. These were hard jobs to get, I understood, but some people did get them. It could be done. What drew me to these Navy pilots wasn&#x2019;t the idea of the &#x201c;right stuff&#x201d;&#x2014;a special quality these few brave men had&#x2014;it was the idea of doing something immensely difficult, risking your life for it, and surviving. It was like a night run in the ambulance, but at the speed of sound. The adults around me who encouraged me to become a doctor thought I liked being an EMT because I liked taking people&#x2019;s blood pressure measurements, stabilizing broken bones, and helping people. But what I craved about the ambulance was the excitement, the difficulty, the unknown, the risk. Here, in a book, I found something I&#x2019;d thought I would never find: an ambition. I closed the book late that night a different person.&nbsp;<br><br>I would be asked many times over the following decades what the beginning of my career as an astronaut was, and I would talk about seeing the moon landing as a kid, or seeing the first shuttle launch. These answers were to some extent true. I never told the story about an eighteen-year-old boy in a tiny, stuffy dorm room, enthralled by swirling sentences describing long-dead pilots. That was the real beginning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>When I became an astronaut and started getting to know my astronaut classmates, many of us shared the same memory of coming downstairs in our pajamas as little kids to watch the moon landing. Most of them had decided, then and there, to go to space one day. At the time, we were promised that Americans would land on the surface of Mars by 1975, when I was eleven. Everything was possible now that we had put a man on the moon. Then NASA lost most of its funding, and our dreams of space were downgraded over the decades. Yet my astronaut class was told we would be the first to go to Mars, and we believed it so fully that we put it on the class patch we wore on our flight jackets, a little red planet rising above the moon and the Earth. Since then, NASA has accomplished the assembly of the International Space Station, the hardest thing human beings have ever achieved. Getting to Mars and back will be even harder, and I have spent a year in space&#x2014; longer than it would take to g...</p><h2>X-Men: Inferno</h2><p>Originally published in magazine form as X-Men #239-243, New Mutants #71-73, X-Factor #36-39.</p><p></p><h2>Mobile Art: Make your home a magical place with these 35 beautiful hanging decorations</h2><p>Thirty-five inspiring and simple mobiles to make for the home, and as gifts.<br><br>Follow Clare Youngs&#x2019; instructions to make your home a magical place, with these fluttering, softly spinning works of art.

Two thousand years have passed since the Apocalypse.</p> <p>In a world wrenched by holy war and devastation, a sorcerer, a concubine, and a warrior find themselves captivated by a mysterious traveller from lands long thought dead, a man who makes weapons of insight and revelation. Unable to distinguish the passion that elevates from the passion that enslaves, they fall ever deeper under his thrall, while what begins as a war of Men against Men threatens to become the first battle of the Second Apocalypse.</p> <p>With this stunning debut, R. Scott Bakker is destined to become the next great fantasy writer of his generation. Set in a world of unparalleled detail and authenticity, populated by truly unforgettable characters, and framed by a profound understanding of the human condition, <i>The Darkness That Comes Before</i> proves that epic fantasy can be at once majestic, intelligent, and terrifying.</p> <p></p></p><p>Many centuries ago, the world was nearly destroyed by the dark wizards of the Consult, and the High King's family was wiped out--or so it seemed. Then from the wild, uncharted north comes a mysterious and extraordinarily powerful philosopher-warrior, Anasurimbor Kellhus, descendant of the ancient High Kings. But the return of the king's bloodline is little cause for rejoicing. For Kellhus's appearance may signal the overthrow of empires, the destruction of the sorcerous schools, the return of the Consult demons--and the end of the world.<p> <i>The Darkness that Comes Before</i> is a strong, impressive, deeply imagined debut novel. However, this first book of an epic fantasy series is not accessible; it reads like a later volume of a complicated ongoing series. Author R. Scott Bakker has created a world that is very different from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, yet in depth of development comes closer than most high-fantasy worlds. In addition to providing five appendices, Bakker attempts to make his complex world clear to readers by filling the prologue and opening chapters with the names of characters, gods, cities, tribes, nations, religions, factions, and sorcerous schools. For many readers, this approach will have the opposite effect of clarity. It's like demonstrating snowflake structure with a blizzard. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Scott Bakker is the recipient of a Canada Council for the Arts Fellowship, a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Fellowship, and the winner of the Helen B. Allison Gold Medal. He is the author of five critically acclaimed novels, including the Prince of Nothing Trilogy, a series that Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly calls &#x201c;a work of unforgettable power.&#x201d; His novels been translated into more than a dozen languages.

The cavern&#x2019;s darkness enveloped her, as did the chill air. It smelled clean here, unsullied, a place that might have remained hidden throughout all the history of the Kings of Sharakhai, perhaps longer. <br> &nbsp;<br> In her hands she held a thick, golden bracelet. She turned it over, again and again, feeling its weight, touching the oval stone, roughing her skin against the intricate designs worked into the gold. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Speak to me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This time, speak to me.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The echoes went on and on. <br> &nbsp;<br> The bracelet had once belonged to King Mesut, the Jackal King, but now it served as an indictment of all the Kings and even of the gods them�selves. It was not the band itself that provided evidence of their treachery, but the onyx stone. Even now she could feel the souls of the seventeen dead asirim within it, clamoring for freedom, pleading for their release. �eda was desperate to give it to them, but after six weeks of trying she still had no idea <i>how</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the night of the great battle in King&#x2019;s Harbor, Mesut had summoned them forth as wights and set them against �eda and Sehid-Alaz, the King of the thirteenth tribe, the crowned asir who had kissed her and set her on this strange new path. It had been a desperate moment, but she&#x2019;d managed to sever Mesut&#x2019;s hand and take the golden band from him. She&#x2019;d pleaded with the ghostly souls to take their revenge against Mesut, and they&#x2019;d answered, descending on Mesut like buzzards. Each rake of their terrible claws had brought them exultation, a taste of their long-awaited revenge, but the joy had been short-lived. No sooner had Mesut succumbed to his wounds than they&#x2019;d been drawn back into their prison and chained once more. The trick to freeing them had eluded her ever since. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By your grace,&#x201d; �eda whispered to the goddess, Nalamae. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cleaving open her mother&#x2019;s flame-shaped locket, she took out the last of her adichara petals. Her mouth watered at the floral scent, and when she placed it beneath her tongue, the mineral taste rushed through her. It warmed her limbs, drove away the cold humidity of the cavern in a way that a fire never could. Clipping the locket closed, she breathed deeply, closed her eyes, and welcomed the sensations that came. <br> &nbsp;<br> She felt the asir, Kerim, somewhere high above her. He was outside the cavern, roaming among the rocks, she guessed. He seemed reticent, as if he were hiding his thoughts and emotions from her. He didn&#x2019;t like the bracelet. He&#x2019;d told her so. She could feel the revulsion within him, though whether it was from the constant reminder of his own fate, or concern for the souls trapped within, she couldn&#x2019;t say. <br> &nbsp;<br> Opening her mind further, she beckoned the souls nearer. When they retreated, she searched for the onyx&#x2019;s boundaries, tried to define them in some way so that she might learn more about the souls within. But as it had every other time she&#x2019;d done this, the gemstone felt unknowable&#x2014; a star in the sky, well beyond the ken of mortal man. When she&#x2019;d taken petals in the past, in or near Sharakhai, she could always sense the blooming fields and the asirim below, trapped in their sandy graves. Even now she could feel them, far, far to the west of the cavern where she and Kerim now hid. She&#x2019;d thought by using the petals she would feel the asirim in the onyx. She&#x2019;d hoped to be able to puzzle out its secrets, to use the asirim&#x2019;s shared bond to free them from their prison or, failing that, simply <i>speak </i>with them as she did with Kerim. To no avail. She&#x2019;d been rebuffed over and over again. Not once in the weeks following the great battle in King&#x2019;s Harbor had she felt nearer to her goal. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Speak,&#x201d; she said, that lone word echoing in the cave. &#x201c;But one word, and I&#x2019;ll know this is not a lost cause.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Her only reply was a miasma of anguish, fear, confusion, and hatred. The same as always. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her concentration was broken, as it was so often of late, by the growls and yapping of wolves. She was tempted to simply let it go on, but when the sound became more fierce, and she felt panic emanating from Kerim, she pulled away from the souls in the bracelet. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; she whispered, and rushed up the winding tunnel toward the sun. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was out of breath by the time she reached the cavern&#x2019;s entrance where, spread before her in a protective fan, were her pack of maned wolves. They&#x2019;d placed themselves between Kerim and the entrance to �eda&#x2019;s cave. Directly before Kerim&#x2019;s crouched form was Mist, a white wolf, hunkered low, ears laid back, teeth bared as a deep growl issued from her throat. She was the very wolf �eda had stumbled across with Emre on her first trip to the blooming fields, the very wolf that had healed �eda and led her here so she could re�cover from her wounds and decide what to do next <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kerim!&#x201d; �eda said as she approached. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim didn&#x2019;t acknowledge her. He was staring at Mist, his jaundiced eyes wild and nervous, as if he couldn&#x2019;t understand how he&#x2019;d come to be here. His disorientation had been getting worse the longer they hid from the Kings&#x2019; forces. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Kerim, back away. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> As she came near, the maned wolves closed ranks, blocking her path. The largest among them, the scarred one she&#x2019;d named Thorn, was padding behind Kerim. Though the pack tried to stop her, �eda pushed her way through them, then charged at Thorn, waving her arms as the wolf darted toward Kerim, silent, teeth bared. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thorn, no!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim turned, arms raised, just in time for Thorn to claw him, to tear at his shriveled, blackened skin. Kerim could have killed him with one blow&#x2014; the asirim were inhumanly strong&#x2014; but he didn&#x2019;t. He backed away, warding off Thorn&#x2019;s advances with arms and hands spread wide. But the danger was far from over. While she&#x2019;d been focused on Thorn, Mist had pad�ded to �eda&#x2019;s left, clearing a path to Kerim. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Back!&#x201d; �eda cried, putting herself between Kerim and the white wolf. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mist&#x2019;s eyes flicked between Kerim and �eda, but she obeyed, and �eda ran to stop Thorn. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim wailed, his bloodshot eyes wild with fear. He swung wildly, an�grily, at Thorn. �eda heard a thud as Kerim&#x2019;s fist struck the wolf&#x2019;s massive head. Thorn was the largest among the wolves&#x2014; with his long legs, his head was higher than �eda&#x2019;s&#x2014; yet he was flung aside by the force of that blow. It brought on a fierce yelp and a renewed fury that drove the entire pack to close in. Their heads were low, growls rumbling from between their bared teeth. They&#x2019;d listened to �eda until now, but with Kerim&#x2019;s attack on their leader, they were ready to excise this hated member from their pack once and for all. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda pulled at Thorn&#x2019;s black mane. &#x201c;Leave him alone!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> But Thorn rounded on her and charged. Jaws snapping, he caught her wrist. She managed to snatch her hand away, but caught several deep gashes while doing so. She stumbled backward and fell as Thorn advanced, snapping at her ankles as she tried to kick him. He&#x2019;d just managed to clamp his jaw over her calf when a blur of ivory flew in. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her leg was freed as Mist and Thorn growled, grappled, and rolled in the sand. The other wolves looked on, their eyes intense as they studied the two wolves locked in battle. It grew so fierce �eda thought they would kill each other, but when Kerim turned and began sprinting over the sand away from them, the wolves finally disengaged. <br> &nbsp;<br> In moments, all their growling and yipping and yowling stopped. They panted, wary but content in Kerim&#x2019;s absence. Thorn was the most animated among them, alternating looks between �eda and Mist, but then he loped off, heading into the shade of the rocky overhang near the cave entrance, where he dropped down and watched, as if daring any to come near and challenge him, �eda included. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mist padded closer to �eda and licked the blood welling from her wounds. They immediately felt better, just as her injuries had weeks ago. Mist did the same to the puncture wounds along �eda&#x2019;s calf while �eda raked her fingers through Mist&#x2019;s cloudy mane. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, then limped after Kerim. <br> &nbsp;<br> She followed the footsteps and the trail of black blood left over the sand, weaving her way between the sentinel-like pillars of rock. She found him a quarter-league away, sitting cross-legged between the dunes, knees hugged to his chest like a child lost in the desert. <br> &nbsp;<br> She crouched by his side, careful not to touch him but close enough that he could feel her warmth. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to stay.&#x201d; She waved her arm to the dunes. &#x201c;You can go, flee into the desert. Surely, somewhere in the Great Mother you might find peace.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t want Kerim to go. Not truly. She wanted to free him or, failing that, find a way for him to have his revenge on the Kings, and how could she do either of those things if he left? But his misery was so great she had to try. <br> &nbsp;<br> His only response was to swivel his head and stare at her left wrist, where Mesut&#x2019;s thick gold band rested. �eda felt the souls in the onyx gemstone, though muted, as they always were in the sunlight. As if he couldn&#x2019;t bear to think about them any longer, Kerim lifted his gaze to meet hers, a silent plea, and then looked to the sword at her side. Her ebon blade. She put her hand on the pommel, knowing that he&#x2019;d contemplated this, his final release, since leaving Sharakhai. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will give it to you, if that&#x2019;s what you wish.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim opened his mouth to speak. A long wheeze came out. He swal�lowed and tried again. <i>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; </i>he said, the lone word coming out in one long rasp. <i>&#x201c;I would . . .&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> She stood and with clear intent laid her hand over the leather grip of River&#x2019;s Daughter. &#x201c;This?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He nodded. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda&#x2019;s heart pounded loud in her ears. She didn&#x2019;t wish to be alone out here, nor did she wish to end a life that might help others to win their free�dom, but she meant what she&#x2019;d said. No one deserved a life like Kerim&#x2019;s. <br> &nbsp;<br> And yet . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must say it, Kerim.&#x201d; She licked her lips, praying he would say no. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it unless you say it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim stood, the blackened skin of his forehead wrinkling. <i>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; </i>he said again, but then he turned sharply to his left, and �eda followed his gaze. <br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond a dozen clutches of standing stones, she saw it, a sleek ship, lateen sails cutting a line across the horizon&#x2014; a royal yacht, from the looks of it. It was not headed directly toward them, but a crewman atop the vulture&#x2019;s nest might see them at any moment. <br> &nbsp;<br> She crouched, pulling Kerim down with her. Her fingers became sticky with the dark, drying blood on his arm. <br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at the blood, lifted his gaze to the ship in the distance, then regarded �eda once more. <i>&#x201c;I cannot leave you.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> She was tempted to ask if he was certain, only her relief was so great she couldn&#x2019;t find the words. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t linger.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> As they headed low and fast toward the cave where the pack had gathered in the shade, she felt Kerim&#x2019;s worry growing. He&#x2019;d managed to resist the Kings&#x2019; call thus far, but could he if a Maiden were close and summoned him, or worse, a King? Ahead, Mist was digging in the sand, most likely for a lizard to eat, or to give to �eda, but stopped when �eda came near. Her ears perked and her head lifted. Perhaps sensing worry in �eda even as �eda felt it in Kerim, Mist returned to the shade of the rocks and lay beside them. <br> &nbsp;<br> A pack once more, they huddled close, while in the distance the yacht drifted across the horizon. It adjusted course once, and �eda thought they&#x2019;d been spotted but, thank the gods, it merely continued in a straight line. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the sails were nearly lost, �eda breathed easier, but Mist was still tense. She gave a soft yip, staring at the rocks above them, then huffed and nipped at �eda&#x2019;s wrist. Wary, �eda stood and, silent as a scarab, climbed the rocks, gained their flattened top, and crawled to the far lip. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the sand below, a hundred paces distant, three skiffs huddled behind a cluster of stones. Three women and a man with a long, sandy beard stood nearby. They watched the horizon, where the tips of the yacht&#x2019;s masts could still be seen, wavering in the heat. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Four to man three skiffs? </i>�eda thought. <i>There must be more crew. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The typical minimum was two to a skiff, but given how much gear she saw inside the hulls, likely a dozen had come. The footprints she saw heading away from the ships confirmed her fears. <br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d grown out of practice with feeling for the hearts of those around her. She tried now, clumsily, and realized too late there were others nearby, some working their way around the bulk of the rock she lay upon&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Stand,&#x201d; came a voice behind her. &#x201c;Slowly.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She stood and turned to find a woman and a man only a few paces away, both holding shamshirs. �eda lifted her hands in peace as the stiff wind tugged at their amber thawbs. Their faces were hidden by the veils of their turbans, but �eda recognized contempt when she saw it. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your sword,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Carefully.&#x201d; She wore a black turban with thread-of-gold embroidered throughout. The small coins adorning the fringes clinked softly in the wind. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am not yours to command,&#x201d; �eda said, lowering her hands until they were loose at her sides. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fool girl,&#x201d; the man said, stepping forward, ready to poke her chest with the tip of his shamshir&#x2014; a warning meant to draw a bit of blood if �eda re�fused to comply. He did it sloppily, betting she&#x2019;d be cowed, but in this he was sadly mistaken. Before his blade could touch her she spun and slid alongside the path of his swing. He tried to recover, but she was inside his guard now and moving quickly. As he pulled his shamshir back, she gripped the blade near the hilt with one hand, his wrist with the other, and followed his movement. She guided the sword back and up, twisting beneath it and controlling him so that his body effectively blocked any advance by his female companion. <br> &nbsp;<br> She had more than enough leverage to snap his wrist or dislocate his arm, but she merely flipped him over his extended arm, taking his sword from him in the process. <br> &nbsp;<br> The woman advanced with a good deal more prudence, but �eda wasted no time. Gripping the shamshir with both hands, she beat the woman&#x2019;s initial swing up, dodged when the expected downward swing came, and brought her shamshir down across the woman&#x2019;s sword with a mighty two-handed chop. The woman lost her grip on it, and the sword clanged loudly against the stone. <br> &nbsp;<br> Things were escalating far too quickly, but when the woman made the foolish decision to reach for her lost sword, �eda had no choice but to hold the man&#x2019;s shamshir against her throat. Thankfully, she took it no further, choosing instead to stand and back away, hands raised.</p><h2>Fly Navy: Discovering the Extraordinary People and Enduring Spirit of Naval Aviation</h2><p>Top Gun <i>was only part of the story</i>.

Nothing about this particular place resembled the warm, sun-washed cruise across a smooth Eastern Pacific Ocean that I had experienced with the VFA-14 Tophatters (their VFA designation stands for fixed-wing [V] Fighter Attack [FA]). The Pacific of my transit was a summer lake compared to the wintry Chesapeake Bay that I found off the shore of Hampton Roads, Virginia. Whitecaps danced on the churning gray water and ominous clouds above made the water grayer still. A biting wind howled across the channel and cut straight through my jacket.<br>One hundred years ago, on a similarly inhospitable November day, a ship very unlike the&nbsp;<i>Nimitz</i>&nbsp;carried a plane very unlike an F/A-18 out into this very channel. The lone aviator aboard the USS&nbsp;<i>Birmingham</i>&nbsp;couldn&#x2019;t swim, didn&#x2019;t like the water, and was known to get seasick. Instead of a polished, carbon fiber helmet with an electronic display like the one worn by Lee Amerine, Eugene Ely wore a leather football helmet along with shoulder pads, and looked more like a turn-of-the-century linebacker than the world&#x2019;s first maritime aviator. His training, attire, and aircraft differed from what I encountered in the men and women aboard the&nbsp;<i>Nimitz</i>&nbsp;in almost every conceivable way&#x2014;but Ely had exactly the same spirit.<br>Wilbur and Orville Wright also shared that spirit, and on windy Atlantic dunes near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, they had performed the first great feat in modern aviation history&#x2014;simply getting airborne. Thus, in 1903, the Wright brothers had opened an entirely new and unconquered realm to pioneers and daredevils alike. In the air, records waited to be broken; new dares awaited the brave. There were plenty of takers, and Eugene Ely would become one of the most famous.<br>Eugene was eighteen when the Wright brothers flew, and he had already become fascinated by the internal combustion engine and the speed, danger, and freedom it could offer. In the late 1800s, when automobiles were quite rare in Eugene&#x2019;s rural corner of Iowa, he began driving and maintaining cars for a local Catholic priest who rightly saw cars as the future of transportation. Eugene became a crack mechanic and standout driver in the process, expert at repairing cars and pressing their limits. From his first minute behind a steering wheel, he loved speed, and Father Smyth only encouraged him. The pair ruffled feathers throughout the community as they flew over the local roads, the accelerator pressed to the floorboard.<br>&#x201c;Ely got a little too smart for the old priest,&#x201d; remembered Iowa minister Louis Rohret, who knew Ely as a boy. &#x201c;[He] used to take the priest&#x2019;s car away with the intent of making some difficult repairs to it. Instead, Ely would run races at the country fairs. The fact that Ely was running in these races finally got back to Father Smyth and he fired him.&#x201d;1<br>Chastened but not in the least discouraged, Eugene struck out for the West to make his mark. He arrived in San Francisco in 1904 where he used his knowledge of engines to become a respected mechanic. His entrepreneurial spirit soon led him to start a car rental company, forerunning naval aviator Jack Taylor&#x2019;s Enterprise Rent-A-Car by half a century. Ely operated the business out of San Francisco and remained by the Bay long enough to marry the petite and attractive Mabel Hall. Then the couple left for Oregon where Eugene indulged his growing interest in aviation&#x2014;which proved well-matched for his adventurous nature and relish for risk.<br>In early 1910, Ely flew his first aircraft&#x2014;a Curtiss biplane&#x2014;and promptly crashed it. Completely unbowed, he bought the plane from its owner, repaired it, and taught himself to fly. He was simultaneously an airplane mechanic, engineer, and pilot. All the skills that aviation would require, he possessed; he played the roles of the modern navy&#x2019;s enlisted ranks and officers alike. All the men and women involved in flying and maintaining navy aircraft can trace their roots to this young man from Iowa.<br>Eugene was a pioneer, expert, and daredevil who rapidly built a reputation as a skilled pilot and expert maintainer. But by late 1910, he had yet to distinguish himself from the other young bucks of aviation who were aiming for distance and altitude records. He began working with entrepreneurial aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss, who had designed the first plane Ely crashed. Curtiss was an exceptionally creative inventor who had designed and raced motorcycles before he began building aircraft. Together, he and Ely devised a plan that could transform aviation.<br>The two men had met in Winnipeg, Canada, during a demonstration show. Ely&#x2019;s keen interest in the mechanics and theories of flight caught the attention of Mr. Curtiss, who was regarded as the day&#x2019;s leading aviator and plane manufacturer. Curtiss recognized talent and immediately hired Ely as an exhibition pilot.<br>Curtiss well understood the possibilities of aviation; he also had interest in profiting from it. With a mutually beneficial contract in mind, he began to approach the U.S. Navy, which had been resisting overtures to develop a real aviation program. To encourage their consideration, he spoke out publically, saying, &#x201c;The battles of the future will be fought in the air. The aeroplane will decide the destiny of nations.... [America&#x2019;s battleships] cannot launch air fighters, and without these to defend them, they would be blown apart in case of war.&#x201d;2<br>He emphasized his point by using aircraft to successfully bomb ship-shaped targets off the coast of New York. That needled the well-established ranks of battleship admirals and also caught the attention of Captain Washington Chambers, the man responsible for exploring aviation&#x2019;s potential for the navy.<br>The three men&#x2014;Curtiss, Chambers, and Ely&#x2014;met at a New York air show late in 1910 and discussed launching and landing an airplane aboard a navy vessel. Chambers knew that a German company had plans to do the same, and the three felt a mutual sense of urgency&#x2014;they wanted themselves, along with their country, to be first. The truth was, however that, like Wilbur Wright, Glenn Curtiss thought flying off a ship might be too dangerous for a pilot to attempt. But Eugene Ely had lost neither his confidence nor his desire to put himself in the record books. Ely and Curtiss proposed staging the flight free of charge and Chambers agreed to build a runway aboard a ship. So it came that seven years after the Wright brothers&#x2019; landmark flight on North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks, twenty-four-year-old Eugene Ely would earn his place among aviation&#x2019;s pioneers by flying a plane off a ship.<br>At its base in Norfolk, Virginia, the U.S. Navy had constructed an eighty-three-foot-long wooden platform on the bow of the cruiser USS&nbsp;<i>Birmingham.</i>&nbsp;From his plane&#x2019;s position at the platform&#x2019;s end, Ely would have fifty-seven feet for takeoff. The navy had craned aboard the&nbsp;<i>Hudson Flyer</i>, a Glenn Curtiss&#x2013;designed biplane already famous for a record-setting flight, and on a blustery November morning, the world&#x2019;s first aircraft-carrying vessel sailed into the Elizabeth River. Crowds had gathered in boats and along the Hampton Roads shoreline to see if Curtiss and his pilot could pull off their feat, which many observers considered more stunt than military experiment. Time would prove them quite wrong.<br>Several storms rolled across the Chesapeake early that afternoon and the&nbsp;<i>Birmingham</i>&nbsp;dropped anchor to await better conditions&#x2014;a decision that agitated Ely considerably. The aviator had spent months preparing for this moment and now felt much like a focused, well-prepared runner who arrives at the starting line only to have officials delay his race. He wasn&#x2019;t the only one frustrated by the inaction. Captain Chambers had risked his reputation on this venture and he feared that if Ely couldn&#x2019;t launch, the observers from Washington would leave scoffing at his idea.<br>A window in the weather finally appeared and the aviator pressed the opportunity. The ship&#x2019;s captain complied and issued the order to begin raising the anchor. Ely&#x2019;s momentary relief evaporated when he discovered the agonizingly slow pace with which the ship reeled in foot after heavy foot of anchor chain. His impatience and frustration returned. Over the next half hour, he fidgeted, paced, and fumed; he checked and rechecked his plane. He was ready, his engine was ready, his plane was ready, and the weather&#x2014;for the moment&#x2014;was also ready. So what if the ship&#x2019;s anchor wasn&#x2019;t? He decided to launch.<br>At 3:16 P.M. on November 14, 1910, Ely gave his idling engine a final rev. Just like modern aviators before a launch, he flexed his rudder and elevators. He signaled a crewman to release the fasteners holding the plane. The crewman hesitated, knowing the captain had not issued an official launch order. Ely repeated the command more emphatically and the crewman complied. The biplane&#x2019;s fifty-horsepower motor pushed it down the slightly inclined deck toward the cold, gray river and a good deal of uncertainty. The primary question in Ely&#x2019;s mind as he rattled forward was whether the little biplane would have enough speed and power to clear the water. Since the ship wasn&#x2019;t under way and thus wasn&#x2019;t generating any wind, Ely prayed his wings would have enough lift to get airborne. He&#x2019;d find the answer at the deck&#x2019;s end.<br>The plane&#x2019;s wheels cleared the deck. Instead of rising, however, the biplane began dropping quickly toward the river. The possible and quite unwelcome answer to Ely&#x2019;s question flashed into his mind, but he wasn&#x2019;t giving up. He pulled hard on the controls, using every bit of his skill to avoid a crash&#x2014;which he did, barely. The wheels dipped into the water and the furiously spinning propeller scraped the waves, slightly damaging the blades. Cold water sprayed over Ely, but he continued urging the plane upward, and thankfully, the determined little biplane slowly began rising away from the water. Ely worried about the effects of his brush with the water and heard the engine begin to vibrate disturbingly. Being a nonswimmer, he had no interest in remaining over the bay any longer than necessary and he scratched his original plan to land at the Norfolk Navy Yard. Instead, he landed on a nearby beach five minutes later, having opened a new era of sea power.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Ely and Curtiss set themselves to accomplishing the other half of their plan. They realized that simply flying a plane from a ship would not truly open the sea to aviation&#x2014;they needed to make a successful shipboard landing as well. Two months later, the twosome traveled to San Francisco to make history once again.<br>January 18, 1911, dawned overcast and chilly but at 11 A.M., the weather lifted and Ely took off from Selfridge Field, just south of the city. He winged his canvas, wood, and wire biplane toward San Francisco&#x2019;s crowded waterfront where the cruiser USS&nbsp;<i>Pennsylvania</i>&nbsp;waited offshore with a 127-foot by 32-foot wooden landing platform on its stern.<br>Before he embarked on this day&#x2019;s mission, Ely&#x2019;s primary challenge had been to determine how to stop his plane on the short platform before he crashed into the ship&#x2019;s superstructure&#x2014;the decks that rise above the ship&#x2019;s hull. A similarly short landing had never been accomplished, so he had no existing model to guide him. Interestingly, or perhaps amazingly, he devised a system that has fundamentally remained unchanged for one hundred years.<br>Ely had lined up a series of sandbags along each side of the landing platform. Between each pair of bags stretched a length of rope. A pair of rails ran parallel along the length of the platform, raising the perpendicular ropes so special hooks on Ely&#x2019;s landing gear would catch them. As the landing gear snagged more bags, the increasing drag would slow and stop the plane&#x2014;in theory. If not, a barricade waited at the platform&#x2019;s end. Today&#x2019;s system of hydraulic arresting cables and a tailhook, while more advanced, stems from Ely&#x2019;s initial ingenuity.<br>Eugene was at once a thrill-seeker and an astute risk manager. He outfitted his plane with pontoons to prevent it from sinking into the bay should it crash. He used a set of bicycle inner tubes as a life preserver. He also saw that a canvas net girded the landing platform in case the plane veered overboard.<br>That morning, Ely&#x2019;s biplane approached the waiting ship, circled over the choppy water, and then began its final approach, coming in at approximately thirty-five miles per hour. A sudden updraft lifted the plane above Ely&#x2019;s desired glide slope at the last moment, and he had to recover quickly. He skillfully put the plane back on slope and set his wheels down near the middle of the landing strip. The plane snared half of the deck&#x2019;s sandbags, and Ely stopped short of the barricade, having made history&#x2019;s first arrested landing.<br>Captain C. F. Pond, the&nbsp;<i>Pennsylvania</i>&#x2019;s commanding officer, called Ely&#x2019;s feat &#x201c;the most important landing since the dove came back to the Ark.&#x201d;3<br>The young pilot landed a celebrity, and Captain Pond hosted a lunch for the attending dignitaries before Ely returned to his plane, started its engine, and rolled forward toward his second shipboard takeoff. On this occasion, he easily cleared the water below and rose into the sky above San Francisco Bay.<br>Upon landing amidst a throng of cheering soldiers at Selfridge Field, Eugene said, &#x201c;It was easy enough. I think the trick could be successfully turned nine times out of ten.&#x201d; Then the soldiers carried off the young civilian aviator in triumph. The next day, the&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Examiner</i>&nbsp;proclaimed, EUGENE ELY REVISES WORLD&#x2019;S NAVAL TACTICS.<br>Naval aviation&#x2019;s journey had begun.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Looking over San Francisco Bay a century later from the deck of the retired aircraft carrier USS&nbsp;<i>Hornet</i>, I contemplated how far naval aviation had progressed. I stood on a flight deck nearly eight hundred feet longer than the temporary wooden structure that had received Ely.&nbsp;<i>Hornet</i>&#x2019;s deck had launched thousands of bomb-laden planes on missions against Japan in the Pacific. It had felt the heat of supersonic jets leaving for missions over Vietnam, and it had welcomed home Neil Armstrong and his crew after mankind&#x2019;s triumphant first steps on the Moon. In all, the carrier had launched more than 115,000 missions during her 30-year career.<br>Yet today, even the imposing forty-thousand-ton&nbsp;<i>Hornet</i>&nbsp;seems small compared to a modern goliath like the&nbsp;<i>Nimitz</i>, with her twin nuclear reactors, ninety-seven-thousand-ton displacement, and air wing comprised of state-of-the-art aircraft. Having walked the decks of both ships, I realized how far innovation and spirit like Eugene Ely&#x2019;s have brought naval aviation.<br>No guides or rulebooks existed for the pioneers who sought to link aviation with sea power. Theirs was an entirely new discipline, with no forerunners to lead the way. Consequently, many men gave their lives trying to push the limits of flight. Less than one year after making history on San Francisco Bay, Eugene Ely died when his plane crashed during a demonstration flight in Macon,...</p><h2>Screams from the Balcony: Selected Letters 1960-1970</h2><p><p><em>Screams from the Balcony</em> is a collection of letters chronicling Charles Bukowski's life as he tries to get published and work at a postal office, all while drinking and gambling.</p></p><p><p><strong>Charles Bukowski</strong>&nbsp;is one of America&#x2019;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet. He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Pulp</em>.</p><p><strong>Abel Debritto</strong>, a former Fulbright scholar and current Marie Curie fellow, works in the digital humanities. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p>This wonderful collection of letters chronicles Bukowski's life from his first days as a poet having meager success through his resignation from his postal job to pursue writing as his sole source of income. In between, the letters reveal in raw and uncensored fashion how a hard-drinking, hard-living man followed his own vision of poetic truth and artistic integrity. Earlier letters are written to the few editors, poets and admirers who had become aware of Bukowski's wild poetry. In them, we see the 40-year-old author struggling to make ends meet through an alcoholic stupor of which he is neither ashamed nor apologetic. We read of his thrill as his first book appears-- directly in the aftermath of the assassination of JFK. Even as his fame grows and his friends are convinced that he has made it, Bukowski remains in ill health and financial insecurity. The honesty, humor and lack of pretension in these letters make them a must for Bukowski fans and an engaging read for anyone interested in literary lives. Reproductions of letters and an afterword by Cooney round out the volume nicely. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Open Country: Text and Photographs</h2><p>The words "open country" often give the illusion of a visual frontier without limits.

Martin is an American author and screenwriter of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. He is best known for his epic A Song of Ice and Fire series.<b><b><i>Love Hurts</i></b></b><br><br>Murphy gestured at the bodies and said, &#x201c;Love hurts.&#x201d;<br><br>I ducked under the crime scene tape and entered the Wrigleyville apartment. The smell of blood and death was thick. It made gallows humor inevitable.<br><br>Murphy stood there looking at me. She wasn&#x2019;t offering explanations. That meant she wanted an unbiased opinion from CPD&#x2019;s Special Investigations consultant&#x2014;who is me, Harry Dresden. As far as I know, I am the only wizard on the planet earning a significant portion of his income working for a law enforcement agency.<br><br>I stopped and looked around, taking inventory.<br><br>Two bodies, naked, male and female, still intertwined in the act. One little pistol, illegal in Chicago, lying upon the limp fingers of the woman. Two gunshot wounds to the temples, one each. There were two overlapping fan-shaped splatters of blood, and more had soaked into the carpet. The bodies stank like hell. Some very unromantic things had happened to them after death.<br><br>I walked a little farther into the room and looked around. Somewhere in the apartment, an old vinyl was playing Queen. Freddie wondered who wanted to live forever. As I listened, the song ended and began again a few seconds later, popping and scratching nostalgically.<br><br>The walls were covered in photographs.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t mean that there were a lot of pictures on the wall, like at great-grandma&#x2019;s house. I mean covered in photographs. Entirely. Completely papered.<br><br>I glanced up. So was the ceiling.<br><br>I took a moment to walk slowly around, looking at pictures. All of them, every single one of them, featured the two dead people together, posed somewhere and looking deliriously happy. I walked and peered. Plenty of the pictures were near-duplicates in most details, except that the subjects wore different sets of clothing&#x2014;generally cutesy matching T-shirts. Most of the sites were tourist spots within Chicago.<br><br>It was as if the couple had gone on the same vacation tour every day, over and over again, collecting the same general batch of pictures each time.<br><br>&#x201c;Matching T-shirts,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Creepy.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy&#x2019;s smile was unpleasant. She was a tiny, compactly muscular woman with blond hair and a button nose. I&#x2019;d say that she was so cute I just wanted to put her in my pocket, but if I tried to do it, she&#x2019;d break my arm. Murph knows martial arts.<br><br>She waited and said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Another suicide pact. That&#x2019;s the third one this month.&#x201d; I gestured at the pictures. &#x201c;Though the others weren&#x2019;t quite so cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Or, ah, in medias res.&#x201d; I shrugged and gestured at the obsessive photographs. &#x201c;This is just crazy.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy lifted one pale eyebrow ever so slightly. &#x201c;Remind me: How much do we pay you to give us advice, Sherlock?&#x201d;<br><br>I grimaced. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah. I know.&#x201d; I was quiet for a while and then said, &#x201c;What were their names?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Greg and Cindy Bardalacki,&#x201d; Murphy said.<br><br>&#x201c;Seemingly unconnected dead people, but they share similar patterns of death. Now we&#x2019;re upgrading to irrational and obsessive behavior as a precursor...&#x201d; I frowned. I checked several of the pictures and went over to eye the bodies. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Oh, hell&#x2019;s bells.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy arched an eyebrow.<br><br>&#x201c;No wedding rings anywhere,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;No wedding pictures. And...&#x201d; I finally found a framed family picture, which looked to have been there for a while, among all the snapshots. Greg and Cindy were both in it, along with an older couple and a younger man.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, Murph,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t a married couple. They were brother and sister.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy eyed the intertwined bodies. There were no signs of struggle. Clothes, champagne flutes, and an empty bubbly bottle lay scattered. &#x201c;Married, no,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Couple, yes.&#x201d; She was unruffled. She&#x2019;d already worked that out for herself.<br><br>&#x201c;Ick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But that explains it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Explains what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;These two. They were together&#x2014;and they went insane doing it. This has the earmarks of someone tampering with their minds.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy squinted at me. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>I spread my hands. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say Greg and Cindy bump into Bad Guy X. Bad Guy X gets into their heads and makes them fall wildly in love and lust with each other. There&#x2019;s nothing they can do about the feelings&#x2014;which seem perfectly natural&#x2014;but on some level they&#x2019;re aware that what they&#x2019;re doing is not what they want, and dementedly wrong besides. Their compromised conscious minds clash with their subconscious and...&#x201d; I gestured at pictures. &#x201c;And it escalates until they can&#x2019;t handle it anymore, and bang.&#x201d; I shot Murphy with my thumb and forefinger.<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re right, they aren&#x2019;t the deceased,&#x201d; Murphy said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re the victims. Big difference. Which is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wish I could say,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;But the only evidence that could prove it one way or another is leaking out onto the floor. If we get a survivor, maybe I could take a peek and see, but barring that, we&#x2019;re stuck with legwork.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy sighed and looked down. &#x201c;Two suicide pacts could&#x2014;technically&#x2014;be a coincidence. Three of them, no way it&#x2019;s natural. This feels more like something&#x2019;s MO. Could it be another one of those Skavis vampires?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They gun for loners,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head. &#x201c;These deaths don&#x2019;t fit their profile.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So. You&#x2019;re telling me that we need to turn up a common denominator to link the victims? Gosh, I wish I could have thought of that on my own.&#x201d;<br><br>I winced. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I glanced over at a couple of other SI detectives in the room, taking pictures of the bodies and documenting the walls and so on. Forensics wasn&#x2019;t on site. They don&#x2019;t like to waste their time on the suicides of the emotionally disturbed, regardless of how bizarre they might be. That was crap work, and as such had been dutifully passed to SI.<br><br>I lowered my voice. &#x201c;If someone is playing mind games, the Council might know something. I&#x2019;ll try to pick up the trail on that end. You start from here. Hopefully, I&#x2019;ll earn my pay and we&#x2019;ll meet in the middle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Murph stared at the bodies and her eyes were haunted. She knew what it was like to be the victim of mental manipulation. I didn&#x2019;t reach out to support her. She hated showing vulnerability, and I didn&#x2019;t want to point out to her that I&#x2019;d noticed.<br><br>Freddie reached a crescendo, which told us that love must die.<br><br>Murphy sighed and called, &#x201c;For the love of God, someone turn off that damned record.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;M SORRY, HARRY,&#x201d; Captain Luccio said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t exactly have orbital satellites for detecting black magic.&#x201d;<br><br>I waited a second to be sure that she was finished. The presence of so much magical talent on the far end of the call meant that at times the lag could stretch out between Chicago and Edinburgh, the headquarters of the White Council of Wizardry. Anastasia Luccio, Captain of the Wardens, my ex-girlfriend, had been readily forthcoming with the information the Council had on any shenanigans going on in Chicago&#x2014;which was exactly nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Too bad we don&#x2019;t, eh?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Unofficially&#x2014;is there anyone who might know anything?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Gatekeeper, perhaps. He has a gift for sensing problem areas. But no one has seen him for weeks, which is hardly unusual. And frankly, Warden Dresden, you&#x2019;re supposed to be the one giving <i>us</i> this kind of information.&#x201d; Her voice was half teasing, half deadly serious. &#x201c;What do you think is happening?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three couples, apparently lovey-dovey as hell, have committed dual suicide in the past two weeks,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;The last two were brother and sister. There were some seriously irrational components to their behavior.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You suspect mental tampering,&#x201d; she said. Her voice was hard.<br><br>Luccio had been a victim, too.<br><br>I found myself smiling somewhat bitterly at no one. She had been, among other things, mindboinked into going out with me. Which was apparently the only way anyone would date me, lately. &#x201c;It seems a reasonable suspicion. I&#x2019;ll let you know what I turn up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Use caution,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t enter any suspect situation without backup on hand. There&#x2019;s too much chance that you could be compromised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Compromised?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Of the two people having this conversation, which one of them exposed the last guy rearranging people&#x2019;s heads?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Touch�,&#x201d; Luccio said. &#x201c;But he got away with it because we were overconfident. So use caution anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Planning on it,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>There was a moment of awkward silence, and then Anastasia said, &#x201c;How have you been, Harry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keeping busy,&#x201d; I said. She had already apologized to me, sort of, for abruptly walking out of my personal life. She&#x2019;d never intended to be there in the first place. There had been a real emotional tsunami around the events of last year, and I wasn&#x2019;t the one who had gotten the most hurt by them. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keeping busy.&#x201d; She was quiet for a moment and then said, &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s over. But I&#x2019;m glad for the time we had together. It made me happy. Sometimes I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br><i>Miss feeling that</i>, I thought, completing the sentence. My throat felt tight. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with happy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, there isn&#x2019;t. When it&#x2019;s real.&#x201d; Her voice softened. &#x201c;Be careful, Harry. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>I STARTED COMBING the supernatural world for answers and got almost nothing. The Little Folk, who could usually be relied on to provide some kind of information, had nothing for me. Their memory for detail is very short, and the deaths had happened too long ago to get me anything but conflicting gibberish.<br><br>I made several mental nighttime sweeps through the city using the scale model of Chicago in my basement, and got nothing but a headache for my trouble.<br><br>I called around the Paranet, the organization of folk with only modest magical gifts, the kind who often found themselves being preyed upon by more powerful supernatural beings. They worked together now, sharing information, communicating successful techniques, and generally overcoming their lack of raw magical muscle with mutually supportive teamwork. They didn&#x2019;t have anything for me, either.<br><br>I hit McAnnally&#x2019;s, a hub of the supernatural social scene, and asked a lot of questions. No one had any answers. Then I started contacting the people I knew in the scene, starting with the ones I thought most likely to provide information. I worked my way methodically down the list, crossing out names, until I got to &#x201c;ask random people on the street.&#x201d;<br><br>There are days when I don&#x2019;t feel like much of a wizard. Or an investigator. Or a wizard investigator.<br><br>Ordinary PIs have a lot of days like that, where you look and look and look for information and find nothing. I get fewer of those days than most, on account of the whole wizard thing giving me a lot more options&#x2014;but sometimes I come up goose eggs anyway.<br><br>I just hate doing it when lives may be in danger.<br><br>Four days later, all I knew was that nobody knew about any black magic happening in Chicago, and the only traces of it I <i>did</i> find were the miniscule amounts of residue left from black magic wrought by those without enough power to be a threat. (Warden Ramirez had coined the phrase &#x201c;dim magic&#x201d; to describe that kind of petty, essentially harmless malice.) There were also the usual traces of dim magic performed subconsciously from a bed of dark emotions, probably by someone who might not even know they had a gift.<br><br>In other words, goose eggs.<br><br>Fortunately, Murphy got the job done.<br><br>Sometimes hard work is way better than magic.<br><br>MURPHY&#x2019;S SATURN HAD gotten a little blown up a couple of years back, sort of my fault, and what with her demotion and all, it would be a while before she&#x2019;d be able to afford something besides her old Harley. For some reason, she didn&#x2019;t want to take the motorcycle, so that left my car, the ever-trusty (almost always) Blue Beetle. It&#x2019;s an old-school VW Bug which had seen me through one nasty scrape after another. More than once, it had been pounded badly, but always it had risen to do battle once more&#x2014;if by battle one means driving somewhere at a sedate speed, without much acceleration and only middling gas mileage.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t start. It&#x2019;s paid for.<br><br>I stopped outside Murphy&#x2019;s little white house, with its little pink rose garden, and rolled down the window on the passenger side. &#x201c;Make like the Dukes of Hazzard,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Door&#x2019;s stuck.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy gave me a narrow look. Then she tried the door. It opened easily. She slid into the passenger seat with a smug smile, closed the door, and didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br><br>&#x201c;Police work has made you cynical,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to ogle my butt, you&#x2019;ll just have to work for it like everyone else, Harry.&#x201d;<br><br>I snorted and put the car in gear. &#x201c;Where we going?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nowhere until you buckle up,&#x201d; she said, putting her own seat belt on.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my car,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the law. You want to get cited? &#x2019;Cause I can do that.&#x201d;<br><br>I debated whether or not it was worth it while she gave me her cop look. And produced a ball-point pen.<br><br>I buckled up.<br><br>Murphy beamed at me. &#x201c;Springfield. Head for I-55.&#x201d;<br><br>I grunted. &#x201c;Kind of out of your jurisdiction.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If we were investigating something,&#x201d; Murphy said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not. We&#x2019;re going to the fair.&#x201d;<br><br>I eyed her sidelong. &#x201c;On a date?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, if someone asks,&#x201d; she said, offhand. Then she froze for a second, and added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a reasonable cover story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. Her cheeks looked a little pink. Neither of us said anything for a little while.<br><br>I merged onto the highway, always fun in a car originally designed to rocket down the autobahn at a blistering one hundred kilometers an hour, and asked Murphy, &#x201c;Springfield?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;State fair,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That was the common denominator.&#x201d;<br><br>I frowned, going over the dates in my head. &#x201c;State fair only runs, what? Ten days?&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy nodded. &#x201c;They shut down tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the first couple died twelve days ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They were both volunteer staff for the fair, and they were down there on the grounds setting up.&#x201d; Murphy lifted a foot to rest her heel on the edge of the passenger seat, frowning out the window. &#x201c;I found skee-ball tickets and one of those chintzy stuffed animals in the second couple&#x2019;s apartment. And the Bardalackis got pulled over for speeding on I-55, five minutes out of Springfield and bound for Chicago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So <i>maybe</i> they went to the fair,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Or maybe they were just taking a road trip or something.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy shrugged. &#x201c;Possibly. But if I assume that it&#x2019;s a coincidence, it doesn&#x2019;t get me anywhere&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ve got nothing. If I assume that there&#x2019;s a connection, we&#x2019;ve got a possible answer.&#x201d;<br><br>I beamed at her. &#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t like reading Parker.&#x201d;<br><br>She eyed me. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t mean his logic isn&#x2019;t sound.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Right.&#x201d;<br><br>She exhaled heavily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the best I&#x2019;ve got. I just hope that if I get you into the general area, you can pick up on whatever is going on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, thinking of walls papered in photographs. &#x201c;Me too.&#x201d;<br><br>THE THING I enjoy the most about places like the state fair is the smells. You get combinations of smells at such events like none found anywhere else. Popcorn, roast nuts, and fast food predominate, and you can get anything you want to clog your arteries or burn out your stomach lining there. ...</p><h2>Cakes, custard and category theory: easy recipes for understanding complex maths</h2><p>&#39;Whatever you think maths is... let go of it now.

He participated in meetings with top-level military and civilian players, where strategy was made and managed. At the same time, he regularly carried a rifle alongside rank-and-file soldiers in combat actions, unusual for a general. Now, as a witness to all levels of military command, Bolger offers a unique assessment of these wars, from 9/11 to the final withdrawal from the region. Writing with hard-won experience and unflinching honesty, Bolger makes the firm case that in Iraq and&nbsp;in Afghanistan, we lost &#x2014; but we didn&#x2019;t have to. Intelligence was garbled. Key decision makers were blinded by spreadsheets or theories. And, at the root of our failure, we never really understood our enemy. <i>Why We Lost</i> is a timely, forceful, and compulsively readable account of these wars from a fresh and authoritative perspective.</p></p><p>HMH hardcover, 2014; previous ISBN 978-0-544-37048-7<b>A high-ranking general&#x2019;s account of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and how it all went wrong</b><br><br> Over a thirty-five-year career, Daniel Bolger rose through the army infantry to become a three-star general, filling key command roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He took part in meetings with top-level military and civilian officials, where strategy was made and managed. But, unlike most generals, he also regularly carried a rifle alongside rank-and-file soldiers in combat. His knowledge of the Global War on Terrorism &#x2014; both in principle and in practice &#x2014; is unmatched.<br><br> Now Bolger offers a unique, unsparing, and fascinating assessment of this epochal conflict, from the run-up to 9/11 to the drawdown of troops more than a decade later. Written with breathtaking immediacy and unflinching honesty, this taut, brave book takes us deep inside the military establishment to explain why we lost &#x2014; and why we didn&#x2019;t have to. Though America boasts the world&#x2019;s best-trained, best-equipped military &#x2014; many of whose thrilling successes and unnerving challenges are recounted here &#x2014; it failed time and again to capitalize on the skills and courage our forces displayed in combat. Intelligence was garbled. Key decision makers were blinded by spreadsheets and theories.

With a fluency of tone that will surprise even his devoted readers, he captures both bewildering horror and heartrending tenderness with an absorbing, compassionate authority. <br><br>We warm to these newcomers&#x2014;as to all Russo&#x2019;s characters&#x2014;almost despite ourselves. A jaded Hollywood moviemaker uncovers a decades-old flame he never knew he&#x2019;d harbored. A precocious fifth grader puzzles over life, love and baseball as he watches his parents&#x2019; marriage dissolve. Another child is forced into a harrowing cross-country escape whose actual purpose he learns only after the fact. An elderly couple rediscovers the power, and the misery, of their relationship during a long-awaited retreat to a resort island. And in the title story, a septuagenarian nun invades the narrator&#x2019;s college writing workshop with an incredible saga.<br><br>A masterful novelist here extends his versatility and accomplishment, in a collection that demonstrates yet again that &#x201c;there is a big, wry heart beating at the center of Russo&#x2019;s fiction&#x201d; (<i>The New Yorker</i>).</p><p>In <i>The Whore's Child</i>, Richard Russo's first collection of short fiction, the 2002 Pulitzer Prize-wining author of <i>Empire Falls</i> explores difficult emotional territory while retaining the assured wisdom and humor of his best work. Infidelity, self-reflection, and the fallibility of memory come into consideration in this entertaining and perceptive collection. The book's titular story sets the tone for the whole: an elderly nun crashes a college writing workshop and composes her own life story, sharing the details of her childhood growing up in a convent as the abandoned daughter of a prostitute. As her troubling story unfolds, the class realizes the fictions she has unknowingly imposed upon it. Other stories examine familial relationships and responsibility: the bittersweet "Joyride" follows the desperate road trip of a mother and son, each running from troubles they won't admit to. The collection's best and most lighthearted story, "The Mysteries of Linwood Hart," explores the daydreaming, curious mind of 10-year-old Linwood as he ponders the self-defeating behavior of his family, the desires of inanimate objects, and his perceived place at the center of the universe. Russo surveys these subjects with skilled ease and accuracy, communicating a quiet understanding of his characters and their personal yet universal concerns. Russo, like Flannery O'Connor, has a gift for conveying the absurdity and severity of everyday life with brutal honesty, humor, and compassion: <blockquote>It was an awful place, but Lin understood it was as perfectly real as every place else in the world, which was large beyond imagining, containing every single place he himself had ever been or never would see in his entire life.</blockquote> Uncommon in its natural insight, <i>The Whore's Child</i> recognizes the often unwelcome realities of experience and is all the more exceptional for it. <i>--Ross Doll</i>&#x201c;An author whose laid-back understatements can be as sharp as other writers&#x2019; boldest declarations....the architect of stories you can&#x2019;t put down.&#x201d; --<i>The New York Times</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;[Russo] has joined those writers who can be said to have coined their own universe....

Challenging Christians both to seek ever more frequent encounters with miraculous matter and to turn to an inward piety that rejected material objects of devotion, such phenomena were by the fifteenth century at the heart of religious practice and polemic. In <i>Christian Materiality</i>, Caroline Walker Bynum describes the miracles themselves, discusses the problems they presented for both church authorities and the ordinary faithful, and probes the basic scientific and religious assumptions about matter that lay behind them. She also analyzes the proliferation of religious art in the later Middle Ages and argues that it called attention to its materiality in sophisticated ways that explain both the animation of images and the hostility to them on the part of iconoclasts.</p><p>Seeing the Christian culture of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as a paradoxical affirmation of the glory and the threat of the natural world, Bynum's study suggests a new understanding of the background to the sixteenth-century reformations, both Protestant and Catholic. Moving beyond the cultural study of &#x201c;the body&#x201d;&#x2015;a field she helped to establish&#x2015;Bynum argues that Western attitudes toward body and person must be placed in the context of changing conceptions of matter itself. Her study has broad theoretical implications, suggesting a new approach to the study of material culture and religious practice.</p></p><p>Caroline Walker Bynum is Professor of Medieval European History, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, and University Professor Emerita at Columbia University. She is the author of<i> Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion</i> and <i>Metamorphosis and Identity</i>, both published by Zone Books.<p>This is one of those rare books that can make one look at the world in a new way...

Ekman also provides commentaries that use the latest scientific knowledge to elaborate, support, and occasionally challenge Darwin's study. For this edition, Ekman has returned to Darwin's original notes in order to produce for the first time a corrected, authoritative text illustrated by drawings and photographs positioned exactly as its author intended.<br> "This new edition of Darwin's extraordinary book is a major event in the human sciences."-Steven Pinker<br> "This new comprehensive edition of Expression will introduce a new generation of readers to Darwin's masterpiece, undiminished and intensely relevant even 125 years after publication."-Oliver Sacks<br> "Ekman's contribution to his edition of Darwin's 1872 monograph can count as a book in its own right."-Ian Hacking, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p><p>&#34;Even cows, when they frisk about from pleasure, throw up their tails in a ridiculous fashion.&#34; So writes Charles Darwin in his magnum opus on how humans and animals display such emotions as fear, anger, disdain, and pleasure; it is work that has in most respects been sustained by later scientific research. First published in 1872, Darwin&#39;s greatest work was never issued in quite the shape its author intended: bits and pieces were left out of subsequent printings, most of them released after Darwin&#39;s death, and later editors made additions to suit the intellectual fashion of their times. This definitive edition, heavily annotated, brings us the book that Darwin would have wanted, and it is essential to any naturalist&#39;s library.A study of the muscular movements of the face (both human and animal) triggered by the emotions being felt - a &#39;physical&#39; response to a &#39;mental&#39; sensation. Darwin&#39;s detailed analysis of what actually happens to the body in a state of fear, or joy, or anger is illustrated by photographic images.</p><h2>Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology</h2><p>This book shows readers how to apply hydrogeology principles to a host of problems related to water supply, contamination, and energy resources. It discusses hydraulic testing, modeling of contaminant transport, process and parameter determination, and remediation. It also addresses porosity, permeability, and flow for continental environments, marine environments, and the borders between them.</p><p>Completely updated, the second edition of this comprehensive volume not only covers all major areas of hydrogeology, it takes a process-oriented, integrated approach so that readers can gain a complete understanding of the relationship between physical and chemical aspects of this subject. Provides a good balance between theory and application and includes new areas such as contaminant hydrogeology. Includes extensive reference list and suggested readings.<p>Patrick A.

Faced with an array of wealthy suitors, New York socialite Lily Bart falls in love with lawyer Lawrence Selden, whose lack of money spoils their chances for happiness together. Dubious business deals and accusations of liaisons with a married man diminish Lily&#x2019;s social status, and as she makes one bad choice after another, she learns how venal and brutally unforgiving the upper crust of New York can be. &amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;ROne of America&#x2019;s finest novels of manners, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe House of Mirth&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is a beautifully written and ultimately tragic account of the human capacity for cruelty.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RJeffrey Meyers&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has published forty-three books, including biographies of Ernest Hemingway, Edmund Wilson, Robert Frost, D.

New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Discourse on Method And The Meditations</h2><p>Rene Descartes was a central figure in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. In his Discourse on Method he outlined the contrast between mathematics and experimental sciences, and the extent to which each one can achieve certainty. Drawing on his own work in geometry, optics, astronomy and physiology, Descartes developed the hypothetical method that characterizes modern science, and this soon came to replace the traditional techniques derived from Aristotle. Many of Descartes&#39; most radical ideas such as the disparity between our perceptions and the realities that cause them have been highly influential in the development of modern philosophy.</p><p>Epictetus (c. 55-135 AD) was a teacher and Greco-Roman philosopher. Originally a slave from Hierapolis in Anatolia (modern Turkey), he was owned for a time by a prominent freedman at the court of the emperor Nero. After gaining his freedom he moved to Nicopolis on the Adriatic coast of Greece and opened a school of philosophy there. His informal lectures (the Discourses) were transcribed and published by his student Arrian, who also composed a digest of Epictetus&#39; teaching known as the Manual (or Enchiridion).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>A practical Guide To Linux Commands, Editors, And Shell Programming</h2><p><p><b>For use with all versions of Linux, including Ubuntu,&#x2122; Fedora,&#x2122; openSUSE,&#x2122; Red Hat,� Debian, Mandriva, Mint, and now OS X, too!</b></p><b> <ul> <li> Get more done faster, and become a true Linux guru by mastering the command line! </li><li> Learn from hundreds of realistic, high-quality examples </li><li> NEW!

The first few chapters quickly bring readers with little computer experience up to speed. The rest of the book is appropriate for more experienced computer users. This book does not describe a particular release or distribution of Linux but rather pertains to all recent versions of Linux. </p><p><b>Command line interface (CLI).</b> In the beginning there was the command line (textual) interface (CLI), which enabled you to give Linux commands from the command line. There was no mouse or icons to drag and drop. Some programs, such as emacs, implemented rudimentary windows using the very minimal graphics available in the ASCII character set. Reverse video helped separate areas of the screen. Linux was born and raised in this environment.</p> <p>Naturally all of the original Linux tools were invoked from the command line. The real power of Linux still lies in this environment, which explains why many Linux professionals work <i>exclusively</i> from the command line. Using clear descriptions and lots of examples, this book shows you how to get the most out of your Linux system using the command line interface. </p><p><b>Linux distributions.</b> A Linux distribution comprises the Linux kernel, utilities, and application programs. Many distributions are available, including Debian, Red Hat, Fedora Core, SUSE, Mandriva (formerly Mandrake), KNOPPIX, and Slackware. Although the distributions differ from one another in various ways, all of them rely on the Linux kernel, utilities, and applications. This book is based on the code that is common to most distributions. As a consequence you can use it regardless of which distribution you are running.</p> <p><b>Overlap.</b> If you read <i>A Practical Guide to Red Hat� Linux�: Fedora Core&#x2122; and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Second Edition,</i> or a subsequent edition, you will notice some overlap between that book and the one you are reading now. The introduction, the appendix on regular expressions, and the chapters on the utilities (Chapter 3 of this book--<i>not</i> Part V), the filesystem, and programming tools are very similar in the two books. The three chapters that cover the Bourne Again Shell (bash) have been expanded and rewritten for this text. Chapters that appear in this book and but not in <i>A Practical Guide to Red Hat� Linux,� Second Edition,</i> include those covering the vim and emacs editors, the TC Shell (tcsh), the gawk and sed languages, and Part V, which describes 80 of the most useful Linux utility programs in detail. </p><p><b>Audience.</b> This book is designed for a wide range of readers. It does not require programming experience, although some experience using a general-purpose computer is helpful. It is appropriate for the following readers: </p><ul><li><i>Students</i> taking a class in which they use Linux </li><li><i>Power users</i> who want to explore the power of Linux from command line </li><li><i>Professionals</i> who use Linux at work </li><li><i>System administrators</i> who need a deeper understanding of Linux and the tools that are available to them </li><li><i>Computer science students</i> who are studying the Linux operating system </li><li><i>Programmers</i> who need to understand the Linux programming environment </li><li><i>Technical executives</i> who want to get a grounding in Linux </li></ul><p><b>Benefits.</b> <i>A Practical Guide to Linux� Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming</i> gives you an in-depth understanding of how to use Linux from the command line. Regardless of your background, it offers the knowledge you need to get on with your work: You will come away from this book understanding how to use Linux, and this text will remain a valuable reference for years to come. </p><p><b>Features of This Book </b></p><p>This book is organized for ease of use in different situations. For example, you can read it from cover to cover to learn command line Linux from the ground up.

The utilities covered in this chapter include </p><ul><li>grep, which searches through files for strings of characters; </li><li>unix2dos, which converts Linux text files to Windows format; </li><li>tar, which creates archive files that can hold many other files; </li><li>bzip2 and gzip, which compress files so that they take up less space on disk and allow you to transfer them over a network more quickly; and </li><li>diff, which displays the differences between two text files. </li></ul><p><b>Chapter 4: The Linux Filesystem</b></p> <p>Discusses the Linux hierarchical filesystem, covering files, filenames, pathnames, working with directories, access permissions, and hard and symbolic links. Understanding the filesystem allows you to organize your data so that you can find information quickly. It also enables you to share some of your files with other users while keeping other files private. </p><p><b>Chapter 5: The Shell</b></p> <p>Explains how to use shell features to make your work faster and easier. All of the features covered in this chapter work with both the bash and tcsh. This chapter discusses</p> <ul><li>Using command-line options to modify the way a command works; </li><li>How a minor change in a command line can redirect input to a command to come from a file instead of the keyboard; </li><li>How to redirect output from a command to go to a file instead of the screen; </li><li>Using pipes to send the output of one utility directly to another utility...</li></ul></p><h2>Developing Story Ideas, Second Edition</h2><p>The vast majority of screenplay and writing books focus on story development and have little to say about the initial concept that generated the piece.

It teaches narrative structure and critical language, and asserts that giving and taking criticism is an essential part of the creative process. It treats fiction and non-fiction as highly related - for fiction needs its roots in the real world, while documentary needs narrative drive and structure to impose meaning on its reality. All the assignments are illustrated with examples of student work and/or pieces drawn from classic works of literature and film, each followed by meaningful and sensitive commentary from the author. Throughout the book the author has placed boxed text to emphasize information that is critical to the success of a particular writing project or to the creative process generally. In this atmosphere people naturally form the friendships, creative partnerships, and teams that make filmmaking gratifying and productive.</p><h2>Hyundai Elantra, 1996-2006 (Haynes Repair Manual)</h2><p>Inside this manual you will find routine maintenance, tune-up procedures, engine repair, cooling and heating, air conditioning, fuel and exhaust, emissions control, ignition, brakes, suspension and steering, electrical systems, and wiring diagrams.</p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Kinsey : A Public/Private Life</h2><p><p><strong>The hidden life of Alfred C. Kinsey, the principal architect of the sexual revolution.</strong></p> In this brilliant, groundbreaking biography, twenty years in the making, James H. Jones presents a moving and even shocking portrait of the man who pierced the veil of reticence surrounding human sexuality. Jones shows that the public image Alfred Kinsey cultivated of disinterested biologist was in fact a carefully crafted public persona. By any measure he was an extraordinary man&#x2015;and a man with secrets.<br><br> Drawing upon never before disclosed facts about Kinsey's childhood, Jones traces the roots of Kinsey's scholarly interest in human sexuality to his tortured upbringing. Between the sexual tensions of the culture and Kinsey's devoutly religious family, Jones depicts Kinsey emerging from childhood with psychological trauma but determined to rescue humanity from the emotional and sexual repression he had suffered. New facts about his marriage, family life, and relationships with students and colleagues enrich this portrait of the complicated, troubled man who transformed the state of public discourse on human sexuality. 30 black-and-white photographs</p><p>This astonishing biography of Alfred Kinsey, the man who launched the sexual revolution, is graphically frank about his decidedly out-of-the-mainstream sexual practices (including masochism and voyeurism), yet historian James Jones doesn't exploit the material for titillation. Instead, Jones argues compassionately and persuasively that Kinsey's personal sexual demons sparked his campaign to demolish Victorian taboos about sex by gathering the scientific data eventually published in <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> (1948) and <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</i> (1953). Jones reveals that the data were hardly as unbiased as Kinsey claimed, but it was world-shaking nonetheless. <i>Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life</i> is a magnificent work of cultural history as well as a sensitive study of a troubled individual.James H. Jones is the award-winning author of Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment and&nbsp;Alfred C. Kinsey: A Life.

Now, James Monaco offers a revised and rewritten third edition incorporating every major aspect of this dynamic medium right up to the present.<br><br>Looking at film from many vantage points, <em>How to Read a Film: Movies, Media, Multimedia</em> explores the medium as both art and craft, sensibility and science, tradition and technology. After examining film's close relation to such other narrative media as the novel, painting, photography, television, and even music, Monaco discusses those elements necessary to understand how films convey meaning and, more importantly, how we can best discern all that a film is attempting to communicate.<br><br>In a key departure from the book's previous editions, the new and still-evolving digital context of film is now emphasized throughout <em>How to Read a Film</em>. A new chapter on multimedia brings media criticism into the twenty-first century with a thorough discussion of topics like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the proximity of both to film. Monaco has likewise doubled the size and scope of his "Film and Media: A Chronology" appendix. The book also features a new introduction, an expanded bibliography, and hundreds of illustrative black-and-white film stills and diagrams.

The exact structure of the trireine has puzzled scholars through the centuries and various attempts have been made to reconstruct the ship. John Morrison, a classical scholar, and John Coates, a naval architect, have perfected a design which they believe fulfils the essential structural requirements as these emerge from a study both of the archaeological evidence and of the historical accounts of sea- battles. A full-size replica of the Threme has now been built in a Greek shipyard following Morrison&#39;s and Coates&#39; specifications and is to be launched in Piraeus this autumn and commissioned into the Hellenic Navy. The Athenian Trireme provides the background and describes the ancient ship in battle and in transit, the men who manned her and the materials of which she was made. In the final chapters, John Coates. discusses fundamentals underlying the design from the point of view of the naval architect and describes the main physical features of the reconstructed ship.</p><p></p><h2>The Hanged Man: A Story of Miracle, Memory, and Colonialism in the Middle Ages</h2><p><p>Seven hundred years ago, executioners led a Welsh rebel named William Cragh to a wintry hill to be hanged. They placed a noose around his neck, dropped him from the gallows, and later pronounced him dead. But was he dead? While no less than nine eyewitnesses attested to his demise, Cragh later proved to be very much alive, his resurrection attributed to the saintly entreaties of the defunct Bishop Thomas de Cantilupe.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Hanged Man</i> tells the story of this putative miracle--why it happened, what it meant, and how we know about it. The nine eyewitness accounts live on in the transcripts of de Cantilupe's canonization hearings, and these previously unexamined documents contribute not only to an enthralling mystery, but to an unprecedented glimpse into the day-to-day workings of medieval society.</p><br><p> While unraveling the haunting tale of the hanged man, Robert Bartlett leads us deeply into the world of lords, rebels, churchmen, papal inquisitors, and other individuals living at the time of conflict and conquest in Wales. In the process, he reconstructs voices that others have failed to find. We hear from the lady of the castle where the hanged man was imprisoned, the laborer who watched the execution, the French bishop charged with investigating the case, and scores of other members of the medieval citizenry. Brimming with the intrigue of a detective novel, <i>The Hanged Man</i> will appeal to both scholars of medieval history and general readers alike.</p></p><p><p>"Superb. Robert Bartlett takes an utterly unnoticed text from the canonization dossier and uses it as a window into the politics, society, culture, and devotional world of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. I can think of no other book that gets as much of the Middle Ages into so small a compass."<b>--Edward Peters, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"The story of <i>The Hanged Man</i> is so good, so well written and so nicely inflected with wry humor that it makes Medieval history come alive."<b>--William Jordan, Princeton University</b></p><b>Robert Bartlett</b> is Wardlaw Professor of Medieval History at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.

You'll follow "the heretic king" Akhenaten, his son Tutankhamun, and their three Amana-Period successors as they employ double-edge diplomacy and military might to defeat competing powers, quell internal insurrections, and keep reluctant subject states in line. This vivid and absorbing chronicle will forever change the way you think about the glories and riches of ancient Egypt.</p><p>Tutankhamun may have been the boy king, but he had a lot of muscle behind him, as did his father Akhenaten, "the heretic king," and their successors in the Eighteenth Dynasty. As you'll discover in Tutankhamun's Armies, the ancient Egyptian Empire could not and did not endure without two key elements: a strong king skilled in the physical arts of war as well as the mental disciplines of strategy and diplomacy; and a large, complex, and sophisticated armed force equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry for battle on land and sea. <p>Based on ancient Egyptian texts and diplomatic correspondence, inscriptions on stone monuments, and information gleaned, from a host of ancient artifacts and private tombs, this in-depth exploration of pharaoh's army fills a yawning gap in our understanding of ancient Egyptian military history, and thus, the civilization as a whole.</p> <p>Yale University Egyptologists John Darnell and Colleen Manassa develop a vivid picture of the forces, engagements, weaponry, strategies, tactics, and political machinations that characterized warfare during the Amarna period of the New Kingdom (1550-1335) B.C.E). It was a time when great empires vied for power and mighty kings and wily princes went to any length to secure alliances and destroy their enemies.</p> <p>From the daily experiences of the common soldier to the strategic decision s of pharaoh and his top generals, this engaging chronicle examines every aspect of the military life of the period. It reveals how the nature of warfare was transformed by the arrival of two powerful new weapons, the chariot and the composite bow, and explores subtle differences in the Egyptians' tactical approach depending on the nature and strength of the opposition, the terrain in which the conflict took place, and the political objective that Pharaoh hoped to achieve.</p> <p>The authors also offer intriguing profiles of Egypt's enemies, including the powerful Hittite Empire of modern-day Turkey and the contentious city-states of Syria and Palestine. Closer to home were the on-again, off-again subject state of Nubia, the source of most of Egypt's gold, and the fierce monads of the Libyan Desert and mountains, where Egypt's chariots were of little use in battle.</p> <p>Compete with a detailed introduction to the historical and geographical background of ancient Egypt and a concise history of military developments and actions in the pre-Amarna Period, Tutankhamun's Armies adds a new dimension to our understanding of ancient Egypt and the harsh reality behind its architectural splendor and dazzling treasures.</p>Egyptologist <b>John Darnell</b> is a Professor in Yale&#x2019;s Department of Near Eastern Languages &amp; Civilizations, and he has considerable field experience, currently directing expeditions in the Egyptian Western Desert.

Today the science of thought control has raced far beyond the dreams of Hitler and Stalin. Methods for destroying individual freedom are being rapidly developed, and the pressures to adopt them are becoming increasingly powerful. Now, in one of the most important, fascinating, and frightening books of his career, Aldous Huxley scrutinizes these and other threats to humanity and demonstrates why we find it virtually impossible to resist them. With overpowering impact, this book is a challenge to complacency and a plea that mankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late.</p><p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing: Materials, Processes, and Systems</h2><p>In this introductory book, Groover not only takes a modern, all-inclusive look at manufacturing processes but also provides substantial coverage of engineering materials and production systems.

When contrasted with &#34;Continental&#34; philosophy, analytical philosophy is often called &#34;Anglo-American.&#34; Michael Dummett argues that this is a misnomer: &#34;Anglo-Austrian&#34; would be a more accurate label, for analytical philosophy arose in the same milieu as the principal rival school of phenomenology. Furthermore, the two schools have the same roots. By reexamining the similar origins of the two traditions, we can come to understand why they later diverged so widely, and thus take the first step toward reconciliation.</p><p>Michael Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic, Emeritus, at the University of Oxford.&#x201c;Dummett rightly says that many of the roots of analytical philosophy are to be found in German-speaking lands...The defining characteristic of analytical philosophy [he argues] is its attempt to base a comprehensive philosophical account of thought on a philosophical account of language. For anyone interested in that project, this book would be an excellent investment. It shows, clearly and concisely, how the essential first step for such a project is what Dummett calls 'the extrusion of thought from the mind.'&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Economist</i></b></p><h2>Sociology: A Brief Introduction 13e</h2><p><p>ISBN: 9781260085419 is an International Student Edition of Sociology: A Brief Introduction 13th Edition<br>by Richard T.

Mr. Richards has cut many passages that are not essential to the storyline and has omitted books 2, 10, 13, and 17. Removing the stylized decoration that can hinder a nonspecialist reader, he makes the language of the poem clearly accessible, and his narrative condensation allows the action to stand out boldly.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Laboratory Manual t/a Hole's Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Fetal Pig Version</h2><p>This best-selling Laboratory Manual, written by Terry R.

Indeed the roster of great names in painting of the Cinquecento, which only begins with those of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, appears to justify this grand claim. Professor Freedberg here discusses the individual painters and analyses the hallmarks of their work. He traces the classical style of the High Renaissance, the Mannerism that succeeded it, and the events, in North Italy especially, that resist stylistic categories. He has given order to this diversity, but at the same time has preserved the intense individuality of the works of art. The fourth edition of this classic work includes colour illustrations and incorporates textual revisions and an updated bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>Aviation and the Role of Government</h2><p><p>The NEW edition of <em><strong>Aviation and the Role of Government</strong></em>, by Harry Lawrence of the Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, features revisions of almost all chapters, several completely rewritten chapters, as well as new statutes and cases added throughout.<br><br><em><strong>Aviation and the Role of Government</strong></em> includes:</p><ul><li>updates to cover all significant aviation related government actions and transportation events including NextGen, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Treaties, Alliances, Space Developments and others</li><li>an expanded history of Pratt &amp; Whitney and its contribution to American world air superiority by the development of the radial engine</li><li>the ongoing contest over slot allocations and ownership between the government and the airlines</li><li>patent litigation history and resolution during WWI by the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p><em><strong>Aviation and the Role of Government</strong></em> chronicles the involvement of government in the evolution of air transportation, including passing mention of early governmental involvement in prior modes of transport, such as the maritime and railroad industries, which formed the foundation of aviation.</p></p><p></p><h2>Concentration and Power in the Food System: Who Controls What We Eat? (Contemporary Food Studies: Economy, Culture and Politics)</h2><p><p>Nearly every day brings news of another merger or acquisition involving the companies that control our food supply. Just how concentrated has this system become? At almost every key stage of the food system, four firms alone control 40% or more of the market, a level above which these companies have the power to drive up prices for consumers and reduce their rate of innovation. Researchers have identified additional problems resulting from these trends, including negative impacts on the environment, human health, and communities.</p><p>This book reveals the dominant corporations, from the supermarket to the seed industry, and the extent of their control over markets. It also analyzes the strategies these firms are using to reshape society in order to further increase their power, particularly in terms of their bearing upon the more vulnerable sections of society, such as recent immigrants, ethnic minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status. Yet this study also shows that these trends are not inevitable. Opposed by numerous efforts, from microbreweries to seed saving networks, it explores how such opposition has encouraged the most powerful firms to make small but positive changes.</p></p><p>A comprehensive and empirically-based overview of the impact of economic and industrial concentration upon the food system and wider economy, from seed to supermarket.<b>Philip H.

In developing criteria for such judgment he attacked at the same time one of the fundamental questions facing all religion: how to distinguish genuine from spurious piety? The Awakening created much bitter controversy; on the one side stood the emotionalists and enthusiasts, and on the other the rationalists, for whom religion was essentially a matter of morality or good conduct and the acceptance of properly formulated doctrine. Edwards, with great analytical skill and enormous biblical learning, showed that both sides were in the wrong. He attacked both a &#x201c;lifeless morality&#x201d; as too pale as to be the essence of religion, and he rejected the excesses of a purely emotional religion more concerned for sensational effects than for the inner transformation of the self, which was, for him, the center of genuine Christianity.</p><p><p>Jonathan Edwards&#x2019;s classic 1746 study <i>Religious Affections</i>&#x2014;abridged and updated&#x2014;describes the signs, true and false, of conversion, highlighting the role of truly balanced emotions in Christian living. Edwards shows that the evidence of true conversion are the &#x201c;religious affections&#x201d;&#x2014;the fruit of the Spirit as described in Galatians 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was a preacher, theologian, and missionary to Native Americans. Edwards &#34;is widely acknowledged to be America&#39;s most important and original philosophical theologian, &#34;and one of America&#39;s greatest intellectuals. Edwards&#39;s theological work is very broad in scope, but he is often associated with his defense of Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life&#39;s work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a very critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first fires of revival in 1733-1735 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. Edwards delivered the sermon &#34;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&#34;, a classic of early American literature, during another wave of revival in 1741, following George Whitefield&#39;s tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is widely known for his many books: The End For Which God Created the World; The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the nineteenth century; and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals read even today. Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation shortly after beginning the presidency at the College of New Jersey (later to be named Princeton University), and was the grandfather of Aaron Burr.</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition (Seventh Edition / Volume 2)</h2><p>Offering a splendid collection of literary masterpieces in the best available translations, The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces is a literal library of Western literature in two portable volumes.

Amazing new tools, materials and skills turn us all into makers. Using technology to make, repair or customize the things we need brings engineering, design and computer science to the masses. Fortunately for educators, this maker movement overlaps with the natural inclinations of children and the power of learning by doing. The active learner is at the center of the learning process, amplifying the best traditions of progressive education.

Digital fabrication, such as 3D printing and physical computing, including Arduino, MaKey MaKey and Raspberry Pi, expands a child&#x2019;s toy and toolboxes with new ways to make things and new things to make. For the first time ever, childhood inventions may be printed, programmed or imbued with interactivity. Recycled materials can be brought back to life.<br><br>While school traditionally separates art and science, theory and practice, such divisions are artificial. The real world just doesn&#x2019;t work that way! Architects are artists. Craftsmen deal in aesthetics, tradition and mathematical precision. Video game developers rely on computer science.

The maker community brings children, hobbyists and professionals together in a glorious celebration of personal expression with a modern flare.<br><br>When 3-D printing, precision cutting, microcomputer control, robotics and computer programming become integral to the art studio, auto shop or physics lab, every student needs access to tools, knowledge and problem solving skills. The maker movement not only blurs the artificial boundaries between subject areas, it erases distinctions between art and science while most importantly obliterating the crippling practice of tracking students in academic pursuits or vocational training.

This new edition has been expanded to take account of the many exciting developments that have occurred&nbsp;over the last ten years.</p> <p></p> <p>The book opens with a historical survey of the methods that have been used to study animal intelligence, and follows by summarizing the contribution made by learning processes to intelligent behavior. Topics include Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, discrimination learning, and categorization. The remainder of the book focuses on animal cognition and covers such topics as memory, navigation, social learning, language and communication, and knowledge representation. Expanded areas include extinction (to which an entire chapter is now devoted), navigation in insects, episodic memory in birds, imitation in birds and primates, and the debate about whether primates are aware of mental states in themselves and others. Issues raised throughout the book are reviewed in a concluding chapter that examines how intelligence is distributed throughout the animal kingdom.</p> <p></p> <p>The broad&nbsp;spectrum of topics covered in this book ensures that it will be of interest to students of psychology, biology, zoology, and neuroscience. Since very little background knowledge is required, the book will be of equal value to anyone simply interested in either animal intelligence, or the animal origins of human intelligence.</p> <p>This textbook is accompanied by&nbsp;online instructor resources which&nbsp;are free of charge to departments who adopt this book as their text.&nbsp;They include chapter-by-chapter lecture slides, an interactive chapter-by-chapter multiple-choice question test bank, and multiple-choice questions in paper and pen format.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Pearce</strong> gained a B.Sc in Psychology from the University of Leeds, and a D.
